### Key Points
- Research suggests that protein biomarkers like GDF-15 and FGF-21 are among the most reliable for identifying mitochondrial diseases (MDs), with GDF-15 often showing higher sensitivity and specificity across primary and secondary forms, though no single biomarker is universally diagnostic.
- Evidence leans toward metabolites such as lactate and pyruvate being useful for initial screening, but their performance can vary due to non-specific elevations in other conditions, making them less ideal for standalone use.
- For specific syndromes like MELAS, biomarkers including ventricular lactate and serum GDF-15 appear elevated more consistently, but results for severity estimation and progression monitoring remain mixed across studies.
- Protein biomarkers generally outperform traditional metabolites in diagnostic accuracy, yet combining them in panels may improve outcomes, as no marker achieves perfect sensitivity and specificity.
- Emerging options like circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) and mitomiRs show promise for progression tracking, but validation in larger cohorts is needed.

### Overview of Biomarker Types
Biofluid biomarkers for MDs mainly include metabolites from energy pathway disruptions, proteins from stress responses, and lipids from membrane changes. These are measured in serum, plasma, urine, or CSF using methods like ELISA for proteins, mass spectrometry for metabolites and lipids, and PCR for nucleic acids. They help in non-invasive assessment, especially useful for pediatric and adult patients with primary (e.g., RC defects) or secondary (e.g., in ASD or NAFLD) MDs.

### Performance in Diagnosis and Screening
GDF-15 offers high utility with sensitivities often above 90% and specificities around 95%, suitable for screening suspected MD cases. FGF-21 performs well for muscle-related MDs, with sensitivities of 67-92% and specificities over 89%. Metabolites like lactate show variable sensitivities (15-100%), better for triage but limited by confounders.

### Applications in Severity and Progression
GDF-15 and FGF-21 correlate with severity scores in conditions like MELAS, but evidence for progression is limited and varies by study. ccf-mtDNA may rise during acute events, aiding monitoring.

### Comparison Across Conditions
In general MDs, GDF-15 has superior AUC (0.94-0.99) over FGF-21 (0.75-0.91). For syndromes like Leigh, low citrulline is specific; in MELAS, lactate ratios help differentiate. Pediatric cohorts show higher elevations in hepatopathies, while adults vary by muscle involvement.

### Comprehensive Systematic Review of Biofluid Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Diseases

Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) represent a diverse group of disorders stemming from primary defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) or secondary dysfunction due to other genetic or environmental factors, impacting energy production and leading to multisystem involvement. Primary MDs include conditions like MELAS, MERRF, Leigh syndrome, KSS, LHON, and CPEO, often caused by mtDNA or nDNA mutations. Secondary MDs arise in contexts like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), NAFLD, or drug-induced effects, where mitochondrial impairment is not the primary etiology but contributes to pathology. This review synthesizes data from human studies (pediatric and adult), drawing from reviews and original research up to 2025, focusing on biofluid biomarkers excluding genetic or MRI types. Biomarkers are categorized by molecular origin, with analytical methods, performance for diagnosis/screening, severity estimation, and progression analysis detailed. For each, sensitivity/specificity, AUC, cohort details (size, conditions, controls, age stratification), and biofluid are reported, emphasizing primary vs. secondary MDs where applicable. While well-established markers like lactate remain foundational, emerging ones like mitomiRs and lipid panels offer new insights, though validation is ongoing. Panels combining markers enhance utility, addressing heterogeneity in MDs.

#### Metabolite Biomarkers
Metabolites originate from disrupted glycolysis, TCA cycle, and amino acid/fatty acid metabolism, reflecting RC inefficiency. They are analyzed via enzymatic assays, MS, or chromatography in blood, urine, or CSF. Performance is variable, often better for screening in pediatric cases with acute presentations, but less specific in adults with chronic forms.
