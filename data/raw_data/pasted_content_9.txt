Biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases display variable performance across diagnosis, screening, severity estimation, and progression analysis, with no single molecule offering universal sensitivity and specificity. Recent advances highlight multi-marker panels and novel proteins, but most biomarkers remain imperfect for disease progression or severity monitoring.

NADH-reductive stress proteins/metabolites	Protein/Metabolite	Blood/Urine	Not stated	Not stated	MELAS patients	Emerging diagnosis/progression
Limitations and Future Directions
Many studies lack robust sensitivity/specificity data or large cohort validation.
Most biomarkers do not reliably estimate severity or track progression; research on longitudinal performance is needed.
Multi-marker biosignatures and omics approaches are promising but require further clinical validation.
Routine markers remain useful as part of broader diagnostic algorithms rather than standalone tests.
Conclusion
GDF-15 measured in serum currently offers the best single-molecule diagnostic performance for mitochondrial diseases in general. Multi-metabolite panels can achieve high specificity for primary mitochondrial diseases. However, no biofluid biomarker reliably estimates severity or progression at present. Combining metabolomic and proteomic approaches may improve future diagnostic and monitoring strategies, but further methodologically robust studies are required to validate these biomarkers across diverse cohorts and clinical settings

Commonly used biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases include lactate, amino acids, organic acids, and acylcarnitine species, typically measured in blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid using targeted metabolomics, but these lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for reliable diagnosis or monitoring of disease progression.
Newer protein biomarkers and circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA have shown improved diagnostic specificity in recent studies, but their sensitivity and specificity values, as well as performance in severity estimation and progression analysis, remain inadequate and require further validation in larger cohorts.
There is a critical need for the development and validation of more specific and sensitive biofluid biomarkers—spanning proteins, lipids, and metabolites—using advanced analytical methods to enable accurate diagnosis, screening, severity estimation, and monitoring of mitochondrial diseases.

Serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (sFGF21) and serum growth differentiation factor 15 (sGDF15), measured in serum via immunoassays, show promising sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing primary mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases, outperforming traditional markers like lactate and pyruvate, though exact cohort sizes and performance metrics vary across studies.
Traditional biomarkers such as lactate, pyruvate, creatine, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids (measured in plasma, serum, or urine via spectrophotometry or chromatography) are useful for screening and supporting diagnosis but lack specificity for mitochondrial diseases, limiting their utility for severity estimation and progression analysis.
No single biofluid biomarker reliably covers all mitochondrial disease syndromes; instead, a biosignature combining multiple metabolite classes (proteins, amino acids, organic acids) measured by various analytical methods is recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy given the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these disorders.

Serum GDF-15, a protein biomarker measured by ELISA, demonstrates superior diagnostic performance for mitochondrial diseases compared to FGF-21, with higher sensitivity (77.8%), specificity (not specified), and area under the ROC curve (94.1%), in a cohort of adult patients (exact cohort size not provided).
GDF-15 is broadly indicative of inherited mitochondrial diseases regardless of clinical phenotype, while FGF-21 is more specific for mitochondrial diseases with muscle involvement.
Combining GDF-15 and FGF-21 does not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy over GDF-15 alone for screening or diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases.

Biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases primarily include metabolites (such as lactate and pyruvate), proteins (like fibroblast growth factor 21 [FGF21] and growth differentiation factor 15 [GDF15]), and lipids, measured in plasma, serum, or urine using methods like ELISA, mass spectrometry, and enzymatic assays.
FGF21 and GDF15 in plasma show high sensitivity (up to 90%) and moderate specificity (60–80%) for diagnosing mitochondrial myopathies, with cohort sizes ranging from 50–200 patients and 30–150 controls; these markers are less effective for screening general mitochondrial diseases or estimating severity/progression across all syndromes.
Lactate and pyruvate levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid are widely used for screening and severity estimation in mitochondrial diseases (cohorts often >100 patients), but their specificity is low (<60%) due to elevation in other conditions, limiting their diagnostic accuracy for individual synd

Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers measured in blood and urine, particularly those related to NADH-reductive stress, show promise for diagnosing and monitoring mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), though specific sensitivity, specificity, and cohort details are not provided.
Emerging omics technologies enable identification of circulating proteins and metabolites that may refine disease characterization and severity estimation in MELAS, with potential for broader application to other mitochondrial diseases.
Analytical methods integrating curated omic databases facilitate the discovery of clinically relevant biofluid biomarkers, but comparative performance across individual mitochondrial syndromes and systematic reporting of diagnostic metrics remain limited in current studies.

Metabolite biomarkers reflecting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation dysfunction, measured in plasma via targeted mass spectrometry, are elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes who experience major adverse cardiac events (MACE), suggesting utility for cardiovascular risk prediction and severity estimation.
Individual metabolites showed significant associations with MACE and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) in both univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with findings validated across two large cohorts (EXSCEL: 978 participants; TECOS: validation cohort), though specific sensitivity and specificity values were not reported.
Exenatide treatment led to greater reductions in these mitochondrial dysfunction-related metabolites compared to placebo, indicating potential for progression analysis and therapeutic monitoring in mitochondrial disease-related cardiovascular risk.

Biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases, such as lactate, pyruvate, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), are most commonly measured in plasma or serum and show moderate sensitivity (60–80%) and specificity (50–75%) for diagnosing primary mitochondrial disease, with cohort sizes typically ranging from 50 to 300 patients and controls.
FGF21 and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), both protein biomarkers, outperform traditional metabolites (lactate, pyruvate) for screening and severity estimation in syndromes like mitochondrial myopathy, with reported sensitivities up to 85% and specificities up to 90%, measured via ELISA in serum or plasma in cohorts of 100–200 subjects.

Multi-omics approaches integrating protein, lipid, and metabolite biomarkers from biofluids (such as plasma, serum, and urine) have shown improved diagnostic power for mitochondrial diseases compared to single-omics methods, but specific sensitivity and specificity values for individual molecules remain underreported.
The performance of biofluid biomarkers for diagnosing, screening, severity estimation, and progression analysis in mitochondrial diseases is promising but limited by high clinical and genetic heterogeneity and small cohort sizes, often lacking detailed breakdowns of patient and control numbers.
Analytical methods for biofluid biomarker detection in mitochondrial diseases commonly include mass spectrometry and immunoassays, with metabolite profiling (e.g., lactate, amino acids) being most frequently used, though robust validation across diverse syndromes is still needed.

Routine biochemical markers measured in plasma and CSF, such as lactate, alanine, and proline (metabolite class), demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity for predicting mitochondrial disease than more invasive muscle biopsy studies, with a cohort size of 85 pediatric patients (36.5% genetically confirmed cases).
The combination of CSF and plasma biochemical tests plus neuroimaging (excluding genetic and MRI biomarkers) showed strong diagnostic accuracy for mitochondrial disorders, supporting their use for screening and diagnosis, though specific sensitivity and specificity values for each molecule are not provided.
Biochemical markers from metabolite classes (e.g., lactate, alanine, proline) are more effective for initial diagnosis and screening than muscle biopsy, but their utility for severity estimation and progression analysis is less established in the available data.

Real-time mitochondrial respirometry measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) shows reduced basal, ATP-linked, maximal, and spare respiratory capacity in NAFLD patients compared to controls (NAFLD: N=19, controls: N=18), suggesting these protein-based functional biomarkers have diagnostic and severity estimation potential.
PBMC mitochondrial respiration parameters are negatively correlated with triglycerides, fasting insulin, HOMA index, and IL-6 levels, and positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol, indicating their utility in monitoring disease progression and metabolic status in NAFLD.
Blood cell respirometry, assessed via high-resolution respirometry analytical methods in plasma-derived PBMCs, is proposed as a noninvasive biomarker panel for NAFLD diagnosis and progression analysis, though specific sensitivity and specificity values are not reported.

Serum biomarkers neurofilament light chain (NfL), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) show utility for diagnosing primary mitochondrial diseases, with NfL indicating central nervous system involvement and FGF21/GDF15 indicating muscle involvement; all were measured in serum using Simoa and ELISA assays in a cohort of 26 genetically confirmed patients.
Neurofilament light chain levels are highest in patients with multisystemic mitochondrial disease affecting the central nervous system (e.g., m.3242A>G mutation) and correlate with disease severity and progression, especially in those with epilepsy (mean NfL: 49.74 pg/ml vs 19.7 pg/ml, P = 0.015).

FGF21 and GDF15 show moderate sensitivity (60–85%) and specificity (70–90%) for diagnosing mitochondrial myopathies in cohorts ranging from 50–200 patients and 30–150 controls, but their performance for screening general mitochondrial diseases or estimating severity/progression is limited by overlap with other metabolic conditions.
Metabolite biomarkers such as elevated plasma lactate and altered amino acid profiles are useful for screening and monitoring disease progression in larger cohorts (>100 patients), but lack specificity for individual mitochondrial syndromes due to similar changes in other metabolic disorders.

Serum lactate, a metabolite biomarker measured in plasma or serum, is widely used for screening and diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases, but its sensitivity and specificity are limited due to overlap with other conditions and variable cohort sizes (often 20–100 patients and matched controls).
Other biofluid biomarkers such as FGF-21 (a protein measured in serum) and GDF-15 (a protein measured in plasma or serum) show improved sensitivity (up to 80–90%) and specificity (up to 85–90%) for diagnosing mitochondrial myopathies, with studies including cohorts of 30–150 patients and controls.
Analytical methods for these biomarkers include ELISA for proteins and enzymatic assays for metabolites, with biomarker performance varying by molecular class (proteins generally outperform metabolites like lactate for severity estimation and progression analysis, especially in multisystemic syndromes).

Mass spectrometry–based proteomics of patient fibroblasts identified five protein biomarkers (GPX4, MORF4L1, MOXD1, MSRA, TMED9) that correlate with mitochondrial disease cohorts, offering potential for diagnosis and severity estimation.
Proteomic profiling allowed classification of patients by biochemical and genetic characteristics, with pathway analysis revealing deregulation in inflammatory and mitochondrial stress responses, including upregulation of glycosphingolipid metabolism and downregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism.
The study cohort included 61 patients with defined mitochondrial disease and 6 with variants of uncertain significance, but specific sensitivity, specificity, biomaterial details (other than fibroblasts), and control numbers were not reported.

Wet biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases include lactate, creatine-kinase, pyruvate, organic acids, amino acids, carnitines, oxidative stress markers, and circulating cytokines, measured in blood, urine, saliva, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but their sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, screening, severity estimation, and progression analysis are generally low and not well validated due to lack of longitudinal studies and standardized cohorts.
Most biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases originate from metabolite classes (e.g., lactate, pyruvate, organic acids), proteins (e.g., creatine-kinase), and lipids (e.g., carnitines), and are typically analyzed using biochemical assays such as spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, or immunoassays.
Cohort details for these biomarkers are often insufficiently reported in the literature, with limited data on cohort size, control numbers, and specific conditions included, making it difficult to compare

High-resolution respirometry (HRR) of platelets from peripheral blood is a minimally invasive protein-based biomarker method that can sensitively detect subtle mitochondrial dysfunction for early diagnosis and monitoring of mitochondrial diseases, but specific sensitivity, specificity, and cohort details are not provided.
Measurement of endogenous coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels in platelets (a lipid-derived biomarker) can aid in early detection of mitochondrial dysfunction and assessment of treatment efficacy, though detailed diagnostic performance metrics and cohort sizes are not specified.
Combining HRR with CoQ10 quantification in platelets may improve the ability to screen for, diagnose, and monitor progression or therapeutic response in mitochondrial diseases, but comparative performance across individual syndromes and detailed analytical validation data are lacking.

Proteomics-based biofluid biomarkers, particularly mitochondrial proteins and their redox states measured in plasma or serum, show promise for diagnosing and monitoring mitochondrial diseases, but sensitivity and specificity values, as well as cohort details, remain underreported in current literature.
Redox proteomics approaches can detect oxidative stress-related protein modifications in biofluids, offering potential for severity estimation and progression analysis in conditions like aging, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic diseases, though systematic comparisons across individual mitochondrial syndromes are lacking.
Analytical methods such as mass spectrometry enable comprehensive profiling of protein abundance and interaction networks in biofluids, but comparative performance data (including sensitivity, specificity, and cohort composition) for individual mitochondrial disease syndromes versus general mitochondrial dysfunction are not yet systematically established.
