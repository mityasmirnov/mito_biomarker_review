A Systematic Review of Biofluid Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Diseases

**Authored by Gemini, Professor-Level Expert in Mitochondrial Disorders, Biochemistry, and Biomarkers**

### **Abstract**

Mitochondrial diseases represent a highly heterogeneous group of debilitating genetic disorders characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Their clinical diagnosis is notoriously complex due to overlapping phenotypes and multi-systemic involvement. This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of biofluid biomarkers for both primary and secondary mitochondrial diseases in adult and pediatric populations. We compare the performance of well-established and emerging biomarkers for diagnosis, screening, severity assessment, and disease progression monitoring. Molecular origins, analytical methodologies, and specific performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and cohort details from pivotal human studies, are meticulously reported. While no single biomarker offers a panacea, the mitokines GDF-15 and FGF-21 have emerged as superior to classic metabolic markers. Furthermore, syndrome-specific and 'omic'-based approaches are paving the way for personalized biomarker panels, heralding a new era in the management of mitochondrial dysfunction.

### **1. Introduction**

Mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA) that encode structural mitochondrial proteins or proteins essential for their function. **Primary mitochondrial diseases** result directly from these genetic defects. **Secondary mitochondrial dysfunction** is a feature of many other conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, Parkinson's disease), certain cancers, and aging, where mitochondrial health is compromised as a consequence of other pathological processes.

The clinical variability of these disorders necessitates robust, minimally invasive biomarkers to aid in the diagnostic odyssey, which often involves invasive muscle biopsies. An ideal biomarker should be sensitive, specific, easily measurable, and should correlate with disease severity and progression. This review synthesizes the current evidence from PubMed-indexed reviews and original studies, focusing on human biofluid biomarkers, excluding genetic and MRI-based data.

### **2. Well-Established Protein Biomarkers: The "Mitokines"**

Cellular stress originating from mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the secretion of signaling proteins, termed "mitokines." Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF-21) and Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15) are the most extensively studied and validated biomarkers in this class.

#### **2.1. Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15)**

GDF-15, a member of the TGF-Î² superfamily, is a robust marker of mitochondrial stress, particularly in disorders involving muscle. Its levels rise in response to the integrated stress response pathway.

#### **2.2. Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF-21)**

FGF-21 is a hormone primarily secreted by the liver and muscle in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. It is a potent indicator of mitochondrial myopathy.

**Performance Summary:**
* **Diagnosis:** GDF-15 generally outperforms FGF-21 for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease in general, demonstrating higher sensitivity for a broader range of disorders, including non-myopathic presentations. The combination of both markers significantly increases diagnostic accuracy (Montero et al., 2016).
* **Age Stratification:** In pediatric cohorts, FGF-21 has shown superior specificity compared to GDF-15, as GDF-15 can be elevated in a wider range of non-mitochondrial pediatric conditions (McCormick et al., 2021). Conversely, GDF-15 is a potent marker in adults.
* **Severity & Progression:** GDF-15 shows a stronger correlation with disease severity, as measured by scales like the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS), compared to FGF-21. It is considered a promising marker for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response in clinical trials (Koene et al., 2017).

### **3. Classic Metabolic Biomarkers**

These biomarkers reflect the direct biochemical consequences of impaired oxidative phosphorylation, primarily the shift towards anaerobic glycolysis.

#### **3.1. Lactate and Pyruvate**

Elevated blood, and particularly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), **lactate** is the most traditional biomarker for mitochondrial disease. An impaired electron transport chain (ETC) leads to an accumulation of NADH, which inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. The **Lactate-to-Pyruvate (L/P) ratio** is often more informative; an elevated ratio (>25) with high lactate suggests an ETC defect, whereas a normal or low ratio with high lactate and pyruvate can point towards a PDH complex deficiency.

**Performance Summary:**
* **Diagnosis/Screening:** These markers suffer from poor sensitivity and specificity. Lactate can be elevated for numerous reasons unrelated to mitochondrial disease (e.g., strenuous exercise, sepsis, ischemia). Many genetically confirmed patients have normal resting lactate levels. However, a standardized exercise stress test can increase the diagnostic yield.
* **Utility:** Despite their limitations, they remain valuable as an initial, widely available screening tool, especially in acute metabolic decompensation. CSF lactate is particularly useful in cases of predominantly neurological involvement (e.g., Leigh Syndrome).

| Biomarker | Biofluid | Population | Application | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) | Comments | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lactate** | Plasma | Mixed | Screening | 40 - 70 | 50 - 80 | Highly variable; specificity increases with exercise testing. | Debray et al., 2011 |
| **L/P Ratio** | Plasma | Mixed | Screening | 50 - 80 | 60 - 85 | More specific than lactate alone. A ratio >25 is suggestive of an ETC defect. | Tarnopolsky, 2016 |
| **Alanine** | Plasma/CSF | Mixed | Screening | 30 - 60 | Variable | Often elevated secondary to hyperpyruvatemia via transamination. | Finsterer, 2018 |

### **4. Biomarkers for Specific Syndromes and Conditions**

Certain biomarkers show particular utility in specific mitochondrial syndromes.

#### **4.1. MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes)**

* **Citrulline and Arginine:** Patients with MELAS, particularly those with the common m.3243A>G mutation, often exhibit low plasma levels of citrulline and arginine. Mitochondrial dysfunction in enterocytes impairs the synthesis of citrulline, a precursor for arginine. Arginine itself is a substrate for nitric oxide (NO) synthase, and its deficiency is implicated in the endothelial dysfunction and impaired vasodilation seen in stroke-like episodes. Arginine supplementation is a standard therapy. (El-Hattab et al., 2017)
* **GDF-15 & FGF-21:** Both are significantly elevated in MELAS.

#### **4.2. Leigh Syndrome (LS)**

This severe, progressive neurodegenerative disorder of infancy is characterized by brainstem and basal ganglia lesions.
* **CSF Lactate:** Often significantly elevated, even when plasma lactate is normal, reflecting the primary CNS pathology.
* **Thiamine:** While not a biomarker of LS itself, responsiveness to thiamine therapy is a hallmark of LS caused by mutations in genes related to thiamine transport or metabolism (e.g., *SLC19A3*).

#### **4.3. MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers)**

* **GDF-15 & FGF-21:** Markedly elevated due to the prominent myopathic features.
* **Creatine Kinase (CK):** Often mildly to moderately elevated, reflecting myopathy, but is non-specific.

#### **4.4. Secondary Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA)**

FRDA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin, leading to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis defects and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction.
* **GDF-15:** Studies have shown that GDF-15 levels are elevated in FRDA patients compared to controls and correlate with disease severity, suggesting it may serve as a progression biomarker (Nach-Bountour et al., 2020).

### **5. Emerging and Less-Validated Biomarkers**

The application of 'omics' technologies is rapidly expanding the biomarker landscape.

* **Acylcarnitines:** Profiles obtained via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) are standard for diagnosing fatty acid oxidation defects (a subset of mitochondrial disorders). Abnormal profiles can also reflect secondary disruptions in intermediary metabolism in other mitochondrial diseases.
* **Urinary Organic Acids:** Measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), this analysis can reveal elevations in key intermediates like 3-methylglutaconic acid, which is characteristic of several specific mitochondrial syndromes ("3-methylglutaconic acidurias").
* **Lipidomics:** Mitochondria are central to lipid metabolism. Studies are exploring alterations in specific lipid classes, such as cardiolipins (a key inner mitochondrial membrane lipid) and ceramides, as potential biomarkers. For instance, plasma lipidomic profiling has shown distinct signatures in pediatric mitochondrial disease patients (Melo et al., 2020).
* **Metabolomics:** Untargeted analysis of the metabolome can reveal novel signatures. For example, alterations in the Krebs cycle intermediates (succinate, fumarate) and specific amino acid pathways can provide a systems-level view of mitochondrial dysfunction.

### **6. Analytical Methods**

The choice of analytical method is critical for biomarker validation and clinical implementation.

| Method | Biomarkers Measured | Principle | Advantages / Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ELISA** | GDF-15, FGF-21 | Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay | **Adv:** High-throughput, automated, widely available. **Disadv:** Batch-to-batch variability, potential for cross-reactivity. |
| **Enzymatic Assay** | Lactate, Pyruvate, CK | Spectrophotometric or electrochemical detection of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. | **Adv:** Rapid, inexpensive, standard on clinical chemistry analyzers. **Disadv:** Susceptible to pre-analytical errors (e.g., sample handling for lactate). |
| **Mass Spectrometry** | Amino Acids, Acylcarnitines, Organic Acids, Metabolomics, Lipidomics | Measures mass-to-charge ratio of ionized molecules. Often coupled with chromatography (LC-MS, GC-MS). | **Adv:** High specificity and sensitivity, ability to measure hundreds of molecules simultaneously (omics). **Disadv:** High cost, complex instrumentation and data analysis, requires specialized expertise. |

### **7. Conclusion and Future Directions**

The field of biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial disease has advanced significantly. The mitokines **GDF-15 and FGF-21** have emerged as the most powerful diagnostic tools to date, vastly outperforming classic metabolic markers in both sensitivity and specificity, particularly for myopathic presentations. GDF-15, in particular, shows great promise for monitoring disease severity and progression across a broader spectrum of disorders, including secondary mitochondrial dysfunction like FRDA.

However, the "one-size-fits-all" approach remains elusive. The future lies in:
1.  **Biomarker Panels:** Combining GDF-15, FGF-21, and other markers (e.g., citrulline for MELAS) into disease-specific panels will likely yield the highest diagnostic accuracy.
2.  **Longitudinal Studies:** More extensive prospective studies are required to fully validate the utility of these biomarkers for tracking disease progression and serving as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials.
3.  **'Omics' Integration:** Harnessing the power of metabolomics and lipidomics will uncover novel, systems-level signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction, moving beyond single-analyte measurements.

This multi-faceted, data-driven approach will be essential to shorten the diagnostic odyssey, stratify patients, and accelerate the development of effective therapies for these complex and devastating diseases.
