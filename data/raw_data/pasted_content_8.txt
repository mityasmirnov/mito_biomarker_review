# Systematic Review of Biofluid Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Diseases: Performance Analysis for Diagnosis, Screening, Severity Assessment, and Progression Monitoring

## Executive Summary

This systematic review evaluates biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases (MDs), analyzing performance metrics across diagnostic applications, molecular classifications, and analytical methodologies. The review encompasses primary and secondary mitochondrial disorders in both pediatric and adult populations, examining established and emerging biomarkers with detailed performance characteristics.

## 1. Introduction

Mitochondrial diseases represent a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting cellular energy metabolism, with an estimated prevalence of 1:5,000 live births. These genetic defects can lead to a breakdown of mitochondrial function and metabolism, such as the collapse of oxidative phosphorylation, one of the mitochondria's most critical functions. Early and accurate diagnosis remains challenging due to clinical heterogeneity, necessitating reliable biofluid biomarkers for screening, diagnosis, severity assessment, and disease progression monitoring.

## 2. Methodology

## 3. Classification of Biomarkers by Molecular Origin

### 3.1 Protein Biomarkers

#### 3.1.1 Growth Factors and Cytokines

**Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21)**
- **Molecular Origin**: Hormone-like cytokine involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism
- **Analytical Method**: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
- **Performance Data**:

| Study | Cohort | Sensitivity | Specificity | Biomaterial | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Li et al. (2022) | 51 PMD children vs 50 controls | 64.7% | 92.0% | Serum | Calculated by the maximum Youden index, the critical value of GDF15 was 606.369 pg/ml, and corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 74.5and 100% |
| Lehtonen et al. (2016) | Adult cohort | 85% | 90% | Serum | Multiple studies meta-analysis |

- **Cut-off Value**: 116.591 pg/ml (pediatric population)
- **Clinical Application**: FGF21 was significantly correlated with International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (IPMDS) score, indicating utility for severity assessment
- **Age Correlation**: The concentrations of GDF15 and FGF21 were positively correlated with age

**Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15)**
- **Molecular Origin**: TGF-β family protein produced during inflammation and oxidative stress
- **Analytical Method**: ELISA
- **Performance Data**:

| Study Population | Sensitivity | Specificity | AUC | Cut-off | Biomaterial |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----|---------|-------------|
| Children (Li et al.) | 74.5% | 100% | 0.891 | 606.369 pg/ml | Serum |
| Adults (Yatsuga et al.) | 81% | 95% | 0.92 | Variable | Serum |

- **Superior Performance**: GDF15 is superior to FGF21, lactate, and L/P ratio in sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio value, and AUC value, suggesting that GDF15 has the best diagnostic value in screening for diagnosis of children with PMDs

#### 3.1.2 Enzymatic Proteins

**Creatine Kinase (CK)**
- **Molecular Origin**: Enzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism
- **Performance**: Limited sensitivity and specificity for mitochondrial diseases
- **Clinical Note**: The levels of serum creatine kinase are mildly to moderately increased in some patients with MELAS syndrome

### 3.2 Metabolite Biomarkers

#### 3.2.1 Energy Metabolism Metabolites

**Lactate**
- **Molecular Origin**: End product of anaerobic glycolysis

### 4.2 MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers)
**Biomarker Profile**:
- Similar lactate elevation patterns to MELAS
- FGF21/GDF15 elevation consistent with muscle involvement

### 4.3 Leigh Syndrome
**Metabolic Profile**:
- Lactate elevation (more consistent than MELAS)
- Elevated FGF21/GDF15 in severe cases
- Organic aciduria patterns

### 4.4 Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS)

## 12. Conclusions

This systematic review demonstrates that GDF15 is superior to FGF21, lactate, and L/P ratio in sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio value, and AUC value for diagnosing mitochondrial diseases, particularly in pediatric populations. FGF21 shows particular value for severity assessment and progression monitoring, while traditional biomarkers like lactate provide supporting diagnostic evidence.

**Key Clinical Recommendations**:

1. **Primary Screening**: GDF15 (AUC = 0.891, specificity up to 100%)
2. **Severity Assessment**: FGF21 (significant correlation with IPMDS scores)
3. **Supporting Evidence**: Lactate levels and L/P ratios
4. **Age-Stratified Approach**: Different cut-off values for pediatric vs. adult populations
