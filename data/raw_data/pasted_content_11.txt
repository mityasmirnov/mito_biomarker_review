Systematic Review: Biofluid Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Diseases
This systematic review synthesizes current evidence on biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases (MDs), focusing on their diagnostic, screening, severity estimation, and progression analysis performance. We stratify findings by molecular class (protein, lipid, metabolite), analytical method, and clinical context (general MD, individual syndromes, pediatric/adult, primary/secondary MD). Genetic and MRI biomarkers are excluded. Only human studies are included, with both reviews and original studies cited.

Overview of Mitochondrial Diseases and Biomarker Needs
Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders, often affecting multiple organs, with variable onset and severity. Diagnosis is challenging due to clinical variability and the lack of highly sensitive and specific non-genetic biomarkers. Biofluid biomarkers are sought for:

Diagnosis (differentiating MD from other disorders)
Screening (early detection)
Severity estimation (correlating with disease burden)
Progression analysis (monitoring over time or with therapy)

Types of Biofluid Biomarkers and Analytical Methods
A. Protein Biomarkers

FGF21 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 21)
GDF15 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15)
Gelsolin
Neurofilament light chain (NfL)
Cell-free circulating mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA)

Analytical methods: ELISA, immunoassays, mass spectrometry
B. Metabolite Biomarkers

Lactate, Pyruvate, Lactate/Pyruvate ratio
Amino acids (e.g., alanine, arginine, citrulline)
Creatine, Creatine kinase
Acylcarnitines
Metabolomic panels (e.g., sorbitol, alanine, myoinositol, cystathionine, N-lactoyl-amino acids, β-hydroxy acylcarnitines, β-hydroxy fatty acids)

Analytical methods: Targeted/untargeted metabolomics (LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR), enzymatic assays
C. Lipid Biomarkers

Lipidomic panels (e.g., lysoPCs, phosphatidylinositols, acylcarnitines, plasmalogens)

Analytical methods: Lipidomics (LC-MS/MS)

Performance of Key Biomarkers
A. FGF21 and GDF15
General Mitochondrial Disease

FGF21: Sensitivity 41–83%, specificity 83–97% (cutoffs vary, e.g., 200–350 pg/ml). Best for muscle-manifesting MDs, especially pediatric cases. Notably, FGF21 is less frequently elevated in non-mitochondrial neuromuscular diseases in children, making it more specific in pediatric cohorts.
GDF15: Sensitivity 66–98%, specificity 64–97%. GDF15 is highly sensitive for MDs, including non-myopathic forms and multisystem disease, but can be elevated in non-mitochondrial diseases (e.g., cancer, renal, cardiac, liver diseases), limiting specificity in adults.

Pediatric MD

GDF15: AUC 0.89, sensitivity 86%, specificity 62% (cutoff ~606 pg/ml). Best for screening/diagnosis.
FGF21: AUC 0.81, sensitivity 76%, specificity 72% (cutoff ~117 pg/ml). Best for severity estimation (correlates with disease severity scores).

Adult MD

Both markers are useful, but specificity is lower due to more comorbidities. GDF15 is more sensitive but less specific than FGF21.

Individual Syndromes

MELAS/MERRF: Both FGF21 and GDF15 are elevated, with GDF15 showing AUC up to 0.99, sensitivity 98%, specificity 100% in some cohorts.

Cohort Details

Studies range from small (n=10–20) to large (n>100), with controls typically healthy or with non-mitochondrial neuromuscular diseases. Both pediatric and adult cohorts are represented.

Biofluid

Serum or plasma; less commonly CSF.

B. Metabolite Biomarkers
Lactate, Pyruvate, Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio

Lactate: Sensitivity 15–100%, specificity 83–100%. Not specific, as many conditions cause lactic acidosis. Sensitivity is higher in MELAS and Leigh syndrome, especially in CSF.
Pyruvate: Sensitivity 35–88%, specificity 81–87%. Similar limitations.
Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio: Sensitivity 12–82%, specificity 69–100%. More specific for mitochondrial dysfunction than lactate alone.

Amino Acids

Alanine: Elevated in MDs, especially MELAS. Sensitivity and specificity not well established but used in diagnostic criteria (e.g., Nijmegen criteria: >450 μM highly specific for MD).
Arginine/Citrulline: Low in MELAS, especially during stroke-like episodes. Useful for monitoring and therapy response.

Creatine and Creatine Kinase

Creatine: Sensitivity 39–60%, specificity 83–93%. Elevated in severe MDs but not specific.
Creatine Kinase: Sensitivity 22–34%, specificity 74–97%. Not specific.

Acylcarnitines

Short-chain and hydroxylated acylcarnitines are elevated in MDs, but overlap with fatty acid oxidation disorders.

Metabolomic Panels

Multi-biomarker panels (e.g., sorbitol, alanine, myoinositol, cystathionine) can distinguish primary MDs from controls with 76% sensitivity and 95% specificity (AUC 0.94). These panels outperform single metabolites.

Biofluid

Plasma, serum, urine, CSF.

C. Lipid Biomarkers
Lipidomic Panels

Phosphatidylinositols (PI 38:6), lysoPCs (20:0, 19:0, 18:0, 17:0): AUC >0.99, sensitivity and specificity near 100% in distinguishing MD patients from controls in small cohorts (n=20 MD, 20 controls). These are emerging biomarkers and require validation in larger, diverse cohorts.

D. Proteomic Approaches

Proteomic profiling of plasma/serum/urine/CSF is increasingly used to identify biomarker panels for MDs. These approaches can identify both known and novel protein biomarkers, but are not yet standardized for clinical use.

Stratification by Patient Group

Pediatric: FGF21 is more specific, GDF15 is more sensitive for diagnosis; both elevated in primary MDs regardless of genotype/phenotype.
Adult: Both FGF21 and GDF15 are useful, but specificity is lower due to comorbidities.
Primary vs. Secondary MD: Both markers elevated in primary MDs; mild elevation in secondary MDs (e.g., epilepsy, DMD) but not to the same degree.
Syndromic (e.g., MELAS, Leigh): Lactate, pyruvate, alanine, arginine/citrulline, and multi-marker panels are particularly useful.

Limitations and Future Directions

No single biomarker achieves perfect sensitivity and specificity for all MDs.
Panels of biomarkers (multi-omics) offer improved diagnostic accuracy.
Lipidomics and metabolomics are promising but require further validation.
Biomarker performance varies by age, phenotype, and disease stage.
Standardization of assays and cutoffs is needed for clinical implementation.

Conclusion

FGF21 and GDF15 are currently the most robust and validated biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases, with GDF15 being the most sensitive for screening and FGF21 more specific in pediatric and muscle-manifesting cases.
Lactate, pyruvate, and alanine remain useful but lack specificity.
Metabolomic and lipidomic panels are emerging with high diagnostic accuracy and may soon complement or surpass single-molecule biomarkers.
No single biomarker is perfect; panels and multi-omics approaches are recommended for optimal diagnosis, severity estimation, and monitoring of mitochondrial diseases.
