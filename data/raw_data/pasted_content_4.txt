# Systematic Review of Biofluid Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Diseases: Performance Comparison and Clinical Applications

## Executive Summary

This systematic review comprehensively analyzes biofluid biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases across **19 distinct biomarker categories**, encompassing data from **over 50 human studies** with cohorts ranging from pediatric to adult populations. **GDF-15 emerges as the superior diagnostic biomarker with 83% sensitivity and 92% specificity**, significantly outperforming FGF-21 (71% sensitivity, 88% specificity) in the largest meta-analysis to date involving 1,563 participants. **CSF neurofilament light chain demonstrates the highest sensitivity (90%) for neurological mitochondrial diseases** in pediatric populations, while **cell-free circulating mtDNA shows specific utility for MELAS syndrome monitoring** with 44% sensitivity but 94% specificity. The evidence strongly supports a tiered diagnostic approach utilizing specific biomarkers for individual mitochondrial syndromes rather than universal screening strategies.[1][2]

## Protein Biomarkers

### Growth Factors and Cytokines

**Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15)**

Meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials (n=1,563, including 845 participants assessed for GDF-15) establishes GDF-15 as the most diagnostically accurate biofluid biomarker currently available for mitochondrial diseases:[2]

- **Sensitivity**: 83% (95% CI: 65-92%)
- **Specificity**: 92% (95% CI: 84-96%)
- **Diagnostic odds ratio**: 52 (95% CI: 13-205)
- **Area under ROC curve**: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96)
- **Biomaterial**: Serum/plasma
- **Analytical method**: ELISA (standardized protocols)

Individual studies demonstrate consistent performance across populations. Yatsuga et al. (n=194; 48 mitochondrial disease patients, 146 controls) reported 97.9% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity using a 710 pg/ml cutoff. The pediatric-specific study by Li et al. (n=131; 51 primary mitochondrial disorders, 30 neuromuscular disease controls, 50 healthy controls) confirmed superior performance in children with 74.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity using a 606.369 pg/ml cutoff.[3][2]

GDF-15 shows particular efficacy in mitochondrial disorders caused by mtDNA mutations affecting translation machinery, especially MELAS and MERRF syndromes. Age-stratified analysis reveals higher diagnostic accuracy in adult versus pediatric populations, with positive correlation between age and baseline GDF-15 levels.[3][1]

**Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF-21)**

FGF-21 serves as a complementary but inferior biomarker to GDF-15:

- **Sensitivity**: 71% (95% CI: 53-84%)
- **Specificity**: 88% (95% CI: 82-93%)  
- **Diagnostic odds ratio**: 18 (95% CI: 6-54)
- **Area under ROC curve**: 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92)
- **Biomaterial**: Serum/plasma
- **Analytical method**: ELISA

Suomalainen et al.'s landmark study (n=141; 67 patients, 74 controls) established FGF-21 with 92.3% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity using a 200 pg/ml cutoff, specifically in muscle-manifesting mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies. However, subsequent studies reveal lower performance in broader mitochondrial disease populations.[2]

FGF-21 demonstrates specific elevation in muscle-involved mitochondrial disorders and correlates with International Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (IPMDS) scores in children, suggesting utility for severity assessment rather than primary diagnosis.[3]

### Neurofilament Light Chain (NF-L)

**Cerebrospinal Fluid NF-L**

CSF NF-L emerges as the most sensitive biomarker for neurological mitochondrial diseases in pediatric populations:

- **Sensitivity**: 90% for mitochondrial encephalopathy patients
- **Specificity**: >90%
- **Area under ROC curve**: 0.90
- **Biomaterial**: CSF
- **Analytical method**: Simoa/ELISA

The definitive pediatric study by Sofou et al. (n=68; 46 mitochondrial encephalopathy patients, 22 controls, age 0-18 years) demonstrated marked elevation in Leigh syndrome, MELAS, and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency. CSF NF-L levels significantly correlated with abnormal brain MRI findings and poorer survival outcomes, establishing prognostic utility beyond diagnosis.[4]

**Serum NF-L**

Serum NF-L provides accessible assessment of CNS involvement:

- **Sensitivity**: 25% for all mitochondrial diseases, significantly higher for CNS-involved cases  
- **Specificity**: 94% (95% CI: 86-102%)
- **Clinical utility**: Identifying central nervous system involvement independent of underlying mitochondrial pathology

Studies demonstrate highest serum NF-L levels in patients with multi-systemic involvement including CNS, particularly those with m.3243A>G mutations and epilepsy.[5][6]

## Metabolite and Small Molecule Biomarkers

### Lactate and Related Compounds

**Cerebrospinal Fluid Lactate**

CSF lactate demonstrates superior diagnostic performance compared to plasma lactate for neurological mitochondrial diseases:

- **Sensitivity**: 88-90% for mitochondrial encephalopathy
- **Specificity**: 88%
- **Area under ROC curve**: 0.88
- **Biomaterial**: CSF
- **Clinical utility**: Reliable marker for mitochondrial disease with neurological involvement

Magner et al.'s pediatric study (n=119; 24 mitochondrial disease patients, 95 controls) confirmed CSF lactate as a reliable diagnostic marker, maintaining significance even after recent seizures. However, the increase was described as mild to moderate, limiting its utility as a standalone diagnostic marker.[7][4]

**Plasma Lactate**

Despite being the most commonly used mitochondrial biomarker, plasma lactate shows limited diagnostic performance:

- **Sensitivity**: 34-62%
- **Specificity**: 83-100%
- **Normal threshold**: <2.1 mmol/L
- **Elevated threshold**: >3.0 mmol/L suggests mitochondrial dysfunction

Multiple studies consistently demonstrate that normal plasma lactate levels do not exclude mitochondrial disease, while truly elevated levels (>3 mmol/L) suggest mitochondrial dysfunction.[8][9][10]

**Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio**

This ratio provides specific diagnostic information for electron transport chain disorders:

- **Sensitivity**: 31%
- **Specificity**: 100%
- **Normal threshold**: <20
- **Clinical utility**: Differentiating ETC disease from pyruvate metabolism disorders when lactate levels are elevated

The lactate/pyruvate ratio demonstrates perfect specificity but poor sensitivity, limiting its utility as a screening tool while maintaining value for confirming electron transport chain involvement.[10][8]

### Amino Acids

**Alanine**

Alanine elevation results from altered redox states in respiratory chain dysfunction:

- **Plasma alanine sensitivity**: 50-67%
- **CSF alanine sensitivity**: 75-85%  
- **Specificity**: 76-89%
- **Analytical method**: Ion exchange chromatography

Studies demonstrate that alanine elevation, particularly in fasting specimens, provides valuable diagnostic information when combined with other metabolic markers. CSF alanine shows superior diagnostic performance compared to plasma levels.[9][11][10]

**Creatine**

Plasma creatine serves as a biomarker reflecting cellular energetic state:

- **Sensitivity**: 27% (primarily severe cases)
- **Specificity**: 76-89%
- **Biomaterial**: Plasma/serum
- **Analytical method**: Spectrophotometry/LC-MS

Creatine elevation correlates with low intracellular phosphocreatine:creatine ratios in respiratory chain disease, but only patients with severe mitochondrial dysfunction demonstrate consistently elevated levels.[12][1]

## Nucleic Acid Biomarkers

### Cell-Free Circulating Mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA)

This novel biomarker shows particular promise for MELAS syndrome:

- **Sensitivity**: 44% for MELAS patients specifically, 25% for all mitochondrial diseases
- **Specificity**: 94% (95% CI: 86-102%)
- **Area under ROC curve**: 0.73 for MELAS, 0.61 for all mitochondrial diseases
- **Biomaterial**: Plasma
- **Analytical method**: qPCR (targeting MT-ND2 or MT-ND1 regions)

Maresca et al.'s comprehensive study (n=123 mitochondrial disease patients) demonstrated that ccf-mtDNA levels significantly increase during acute events (stroke-like episodes) and correlate with disease progression specifically in MELAS patients. Longitudinal assessment in four MELAS patients showed increased levels during acute events or neurodegeneration progression.[1]

## Lipid and Oxidative Stress Biomarkers

### Oxidative Stress Markers

**Malondialdehyde (MDA)**

MDA serves as a marker of lipid peroxidation:

- **Clinical findings**: Significantly elevated in progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients with COX deficiency
- **Biomaterial**: Plasma
- **Analytical method**: Spectrophotometry/HPLC

Pietta et al.'s study (n=17; 11 PEO patients, 6 controls) demonstrated significantly higher MDA levels, indicating increased lipid peroxidation associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.[13]

**Glutathione Status**

Reduced glutathione (GSH) reflects antioxidant capacity:

- **Clinical findings**: Significantly decreased in mitochondrial myopathies
- **Biomaterial**: Plasma/erythrocytes  
- **Analytical method**: Spectrophotometry

The same PEO cohort showed significantly lower plasma and erythrocyte GSH concentrations, indicating compromised antioxidant systems.[13]

## Disease-Specific Biomarker Profiles

### MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Stroke-like Episodes)

**Primary biomarkers**: ccf-mtDNA, serum NF-L, GDF-15, lactate

The most comprehensive MELAS biomarker study involved 13 symptomatic patients carrying the A3243G mutation with 207 voxels from 41 MRS studies. Key findings:[8]

- **ccf-mtDNA**: 44% sensitivity, 94% specificity, elevated during acute stroke-like episodes
- **Serum lactate**: Correlation with MRS lactate peak during acute phases (P=0.02)
- **Lactate/pyruvate ratio**: Strong correlation with MRS lactate peak severity (P=0.0007) in acute regions

Longitudinal assessment demonstrates ccf-mtDNA as the optimal biomarker for monitoring acute episodes and disease progression.[8][1]

### MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers)

**Primary biomarkers**: GDF-15, FGF-21, lactate, creatine kinase

MERRF patients demonstrate consistent elevation in GDF-15 and FGF-21, with studies showing 97.9% sensitivity for GDF-15 in mixed mitochondrial disease cohorts that included MERRF patients. The syndrome presents with heteroplasmy levels ranging from 97.6±0.7% in Purkinje cells to 80.6±2.8% in anterior horn cells.[14][2]

### Leigh Syndrome

**Primary biomarkers**: CSF NF-L, CSF lactate, GDF-15

Pediatric Leigh syndrome patients show marked CSF NF-L elevation compared to controls, with correlation to abnormal brain MRI and survival outcomes. The Sofou et al. study demonstrated CSF NF-L as particularly elevated in Leigh syndrome, MELAS, and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency.[4]

### Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)

**Primary biomarkers**: Structural OCT measures, clinical assessment

LHON biomarker research focuses on structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) rather than serum biomarkers. The Irish LHON cohort study (n=44 patients from 34 pedigrees) identified preservation of nasal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) as the best predictor of on-chart final visual acuity.[15]

OCT biomarker analysis in idebenone-treated patients (n=17, 34 eyes) revealed superior macular ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness as strongest predictors of long-term visual outcomes:

- **Superior macular GC-IPL**: P=0.044 for final visual acuity
- **Superotemporal macular GC-IPL**: P=0.010 for final visual acuity  
- **Inferotemporal macular GC-IPL**: P=0.015 for final visual acuity[16]

## Specialized Syndrome Biomarkers

### Barth Syndrome

**Definitive biomarkers**: Cardiolipin ratios, 3-methylglutaconic acid, arginine

Barth syndrome demonstrates 100% diagnostic accuracy through cardiolipin analysis:

- **Tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin (L4-CL)**: Complete absence in affected tissues
- **Monolysocardiolipin (L3-MLCL)**: Pathological accumulation
- **3-methylglutaconic acid**: Elevated in plasma and urine (100% of cases in Vernon cohort)[17][18]
- **Plasma arginine**: Significantly decreased levels

Vernon et al.'s comprehensive study (n=28 Barth syndrome patients, ages 10 months-30 years) confirmed 3-methylglutaconic acid elevation in 100% of patients, with additional findings of decreased plasma arginine levels.[18]

### Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy (EE)

**Definitive biomarkers**: Thiosulfate, ethylmalonic acid, H2S metabolites

EE presents with pathognomonic biomarker profile:

- **Thiosulfate**: 100% sensitivity, 95-100% specificity
- **Ethylmalonic acid**: Elevated in plasma and urine
- **H2S metabolites**: Tissue accumulation causing COX inhibition

Tiranti et al.'s studies demonstrate thiosulfate as a stable, easily measurable compound directly reflecting H2S accumulation, serving as a specific biomarker for ETHE1 deficiency.[19][20][21]

### TK2 Deficiency

**Primary biomarkers**: GDF-15, mtDNA depletion, creatine

TK2 deficiency studies demonstrate consistent GDF-15 elevation across all affected patients. The condition causes mtDNA depletion ranging from <30% of control levels in muscle and liver, with GDF-15 serving as a potential therapeutic response biomarker.[22][23]

### Coenzyme Q10 Deficiency

**Primary biomarkers**: Plasma CoQ10 levels, ubiquinol/ubiquinone ratio

- **Normal plasma range**: 0.5-1.7 μM  
- **Therapeutic target**: 2.8-4.6 μM depending on condition
- **Analytical method**: HPLC-UV or HPLC-ED

Langsjoen et al.'s bioavailability study (n=12 healthy volunteers) demonstrated ubiquinol supplementation achieving significantly higher plasma levels (4.3 μg/mL) compared to ubiquinone (2.5 μg/mL) after 4 weeks.[24]

## Secondary Mitochondrial Diseases

### Drug-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction

**Common causative agents**: Doxorubicin, statins, tetracycline antibiotics, valproic acid

Drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity presents with variable biomarker patterns:

- **Doxorubicin**: Elevated oxidative stress markers, impaired AMPK pathway, decreased GLUT4 expression
- **Statins**: Variable CoQ10 depletion, myopathy markers
- **Antibiotics**: Mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition, oxidative stress

Recent studies demonstrate doxorubicin-induced hyperglycemia associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, with risk factors including corticosteroid co-administration.[25]

### mtDNA Maintenance Defects

**Genes involved**: POLG, TWNK, DNA2, MGME1, TK2, DGUOK, MPV17

mtDNA maintenance defects present with distinctive biomarker patterns:

- **mtDNA depletion**: <35% of normal levels in affected tissues
- **Multiple deletions**: Accumulation of large-scale mtDNA deletions  
- **GDF-15 elevation**: Consistent finding across maintenance defect disorders

Recent identification of DNA2 mutations causing mitochondrial depletion syndrome expands the genetic spectrum, with functional studies confirming mtDNA copy number decrement and reduced ATP levels.[26]

## Age-Specific Considerations

### Pediatric Populations

**Superior pediatric biomarkers**:
1. **CSF NF-L**: 90% sensitivity in pediatric mitochondrial encephalopathy
2. **GDF-15**: 74.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity in children  
3. **CSF lactate**: More reliable than plasma lactate in pediatric populations

The Li et al. pediatric study (median age 5.6 years) demonstrated that GDF-15 cutoff values require age-specific adjustment, with children requiring lower thresholds (606.369 pg/ml) compared to adults.[3]

**Age-related findings**:
- FGF-21 correlation with IPMDS scores in children
- GDF-15 positive correlation with age in both patients and controls
- Earlier symptom onset correlates with better post-diagnosis developmental outcomes[27]

### Adult Populations  

Adult-specific considerations include:

- **Higher baseline biomarker levels**: Age-related increases in GDF-15 and oxidative stress markers
- **Better GDF-15 performance**: Superior diagnostic accuracy compared to pediatric populations
