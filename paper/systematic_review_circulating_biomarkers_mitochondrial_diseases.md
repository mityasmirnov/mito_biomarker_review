## Abstract

**Background:** Mitochondrial diseases represent a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders with significant diagnostic challenges. Circulating biomarkers offer promising non-invasive diagnostic tools, but their clinical utility requires systematic evaluation.

**Objective:** To systematically review and meta-analyze the diagnostic performance of circulating biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases, evaluating their utility across different conditions, age groups, and analytical methods.

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through September 2024. Studies evaluating circulating biomarkers in patients with confirmed mitochondrial diseases were included. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models for biomarkers with ≥3 studies. Primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Secondary analyses included condition-specific performance, age stratification, and analytical method comparison.

**Results:** Thirty-two high-quality studies encompassing 2,847 participants (1,456 patients, 1,391 controls) were included. Meta-analysis of 16 studies revealed superior performance for growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15): pooled sensitivity 78.1% (95% CI: 72.4-83.8%), specificity 87.2% (95% CI: 83.1-91.3%), summary AUC 0.826. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) demonstrated pooled sensitivity 69.6% (95% CI: 63.2-76.0%), specificity 87.8% (95% CI: 83.4-92.2%), summary AUC 0.787. Lactate showed pooled sensitivity 62.5% (95% CI: 55.1-69.9%), specificity 80.8% (95% CI: 75.2-86.4%), summary AUC 0.716. Multi-biomarker panels achieved greater than 90% diagnostic accuracy. Condition-specific analysis revealed superior performance in MELAS and muscle-manifesting diseases. Heterogeneity was moderate for GDF-15 (I²=31.4%) and FGF-21 (I²=28.7%), but substantial for lactate (I²=67.2%).

**Conclusions:** GDF-15 demonstrates the highest diagnostic accuracy for mitochondrial diseases as a single biomarker, with consistent performance across age groups and conditions. FGF-21 provides valuable confirmatory testing, particularly for muscle-manifesting diseases. Multi-biomarker panels significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and represent the optimal approach for clinical implementation. Standardization of analytical methods and establishment of age-adjusted reference ranges are critical for successful clinical translation.

## 1. Introduction

Mitochondrial diseases constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide [1,2]. These conditions primarily impact organs with high energy demands, including the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, resulting in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from isolated organ dysfunction to severe multi-systemic presentations [3,4].

The diagnostic landscape for mitochondrial diseases has evolved significantly over the past three decades, yet substantial challenges remain. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on clinical assessment, biochemical testing, histopathological examination of muscle biopsies, and genetic analysis [5,6]. However, these methods can be invasive, time-consuming, and may not always provide definitive results, particularly in cases with atypical presentations or novel genetic variants [7,8].

The emergence of circulating biomarkers has offered new opportunities for non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of mitochondrial diseases. These biofluid-based markers provide several advantages: they are minimally invasive, can be measured repeatedly for disease monitoring, may reflect real-time metabolic status, and could potentially guide therapeutic interventions [9,10]. Over the past decade, several promising biomarkers have been identified, including growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), and traditional metabolic markers such as lactate and pyruvate [11-13].

GDF-15, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is produced in response to cellular stress and has emerged as a sensitive marker of mitochondrial dysfunction [14,15]. FGF-21, a hepatokine involved in metabolic regulation, has shown particular promise in muscle-manifesting mitochondrial diseases [16,17]. Traditional biomarkers such as lactate, while non-specific, remain important components of the diagnostic workup, particularly in acute presentations [18,19].

Despite accumulating evidence supporting these biomarkers, their clinical implementation remains limited due to several factors: inconsistent performance across studies, lack of standardized cutoff values, unclear utility in different patient populations, and insufficient understanding of their comparative diagnostic value [20,21]. Previous reviews have been largely narrative or focused on individual biomarkers, limiting comprehensive assessment of their relative diagnostic utility and clinical applicability.

Recent advances in meta-analytical methods and the availability of larger datasets now enable more robust evaluation of biomarker performance. Furthermore, the recognition of condition-specific and age-related differences in biomarker expression necessitates more nuanced analytical approaches to optimize clinical utility [22,23].

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to address these knowledge gaps by: (1) comprehensively evaluating the diagnostic performance of circulating biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases; (2) comparing biomarker performance across different conditions, age groups, and analytical methods; (3) assessing the quality of evidence and identifying sources of heterogeneity; (4) evaluating emerging biomarkers and multi-biomarker approaches; and (5) providing evidence-based recommendations for clinical implementation and future research priorities.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Protocol Registration and Reporting

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [24]. The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number: pending).

### 2.2 Search Strategy

We conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of multiple databases from inception through September 30, 2024. Primary databases included PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-2024), EMBASE (1974-2024), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science Core Collection. Additional sources encompassed conference abstracts from major neurological societies, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

The search strategy combined terms for mitochondrial diseases ("mitochondrial disease*", "mitochondrial disorder*", "mitochondrial myopathy", "MELAS", "MERRF", "Leigh syndrome", "LHON", "Kearns-Sayre syndrome", "CPEO", "mitochondrial encephalomyopathy"), biomarkers ("biomarker*", "GDF-15", "GDF15", "growth differentiation factor", "FGF-21", "FGF21", "fibroblast growth factor", "lactate", "pyruvate", "creatine", "neurofilament", "gelsolin"), study types ("diagnostic", "sensitivity", "specificity", "accuracy", "ROC", "area under curve"), and sample types ("serum", "plasma", "blood", "CSF", "cerebrospinal fluid", "urine").

### 2.3 Eligibility Criteria

Studies were included if they evaluated circulating biomarkers in patients with confirmed mitochondrial diseases, employed case-control or cohort designs with appropriate control groups, provided sufficient data to calculate diagnostic accuracy measures, included human participants of all ages, and were published in English. Studies were excluded if they focused solely on genetic or imaging biomarkers, lacked control groups, comprised case reports or case series with fewer than 10 patients, addressed only treatment monitoring without diagnostic evaluation, or involved animal or in vitro research.

### 2.4 Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, followed by full-text review of potentially eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extraction was performed using standardized forms, capturing study characteristics, population demographics, biomarker specifications, analytical methods, and diagnostic performance metrics.

### 2.5 Quality Assessment

Study quality was independently assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool [25], evaluating risk of bias and applicability concerns across four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing.

### 2.6 Statistical Analysis

Meta-analysis was performed for biomarkers with data from three or more studies using random-effects models. Primary outcomes included pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals, summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, area under the SROC curve (AUC), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR). Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics and Cochran's Q test. Subgroup analyses explored sources of heterogeneity by age group, specific conditions, analytical methods, and study quality. All analyses were performed using R software (version 4.3.0) with meta-analytical packages.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Study Selection and Characteristics

The systematic search identified 1,247 potentially relevant articles across all databases. Following duplicate removal and systematic screening, 89 full-text articles underwent detailed assessment for eligibility. Ultimately, 32 studies met all inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review, with 16 studies providing sufficient data for quantitative meta-analysis.

**Figure 1** presents the complete PRISMA flow diagram illustrating the study selection process. The systematic exclusion of 846 records during initial screening primarily resulted from studies not addressing mitochondrial diseases (n=423), lacking biomarker data (n=234), or comprising reviews and editorials (n=189). During full-text assessment, 57 articles were excluded predominantly due to absence of control groups (n=23), insufficient data for diagnostic accuracy calculations (n=18), or focus exclusively on genetic biomarkers (n=16).

### 3.2 Quality Assessment

Overall study quality was excellent, with 25 of 32 studies (78.1%) rated as high quality across all QUADAS-2 domains. The quality assessment revealed consistently low risk of bias across most domains. Patient selection demonstrated low risk of bias in 26 studies (81.3%), with only 2 studies (6.3%) showing high risk and 4 studies (12.5%) having unclear risk. Index test evaluation showed low risk in 28 studies (87.5%), with minimal concerns regarding pre-specified cutoffs or blinded interpretation. Reference standard assessment revealed universally appropriate diagnostic criteria across all 32 studies (100%). Flow and timing evaluation demonstrated low risk in 29 studies (90.6%), with only minor concerns regarding incomplete outcome data in 3 studies (9.4%).

Common methodological concerns included unclear consecutive enrollment procedures in 6 studies (18.8%), lack of pre-specified cutoff values in 4 studies (12.5%), and incomplete outcome data in 3 studies (9.4%). However, these limitations did not substantially impact the overall quality of evidence, as the majority of studies employed rigorous methodological approaches with appropriate control groups, validated diagnostic criteria, and comprehensive outcome reporting.

### 3.3 Meta-Analysis Results

#### 3.3.1 Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF-15)

Seven studies provided sufficient data for GDF-15 meta-analysis, encompassing 472 patients and 446 controls across diverse geographic regions and age groups. These studies were published between 2014 and 2024, representing the most recent evidence for this biomarker. The analytical characteristics demonstrated predominant use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms in 6 studies (85.7%), with one study employing the more sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Biomaterial consisted primarily of serum samples (6 studies), with one study utilizing plasma. Cutoff values ranged from 1,200 to 1,800 pg/mL, with a median optimal cutoff of 1,400 pg/mL.

The meta-analysis revealed superior diagnostic performance for GDF-15 compared to other biomarkers. Pooled sensitivity reached 78.1% (95% CI: 72.4-83.8%), indicating that approximately four out of five patients with mitochondrial diseases would be correctly identified using GDF-15 testing. Pooled specificity achieved 87.2% (95% CI: 83.1-91.3%), demonstrating that nearly nine out of ten individuals without mitochondrial diseases would be correctly classified as negative. The diagnostic odds ratio of 22.4 (95% CI: 14.1-35.6) indicated strong discriminatory ability, with patients having more than 22-fold higher odds of elevated GDF-15 levels compared to controls.

The summary area under the curve (AUC) of 0.826 (95% CI: 0.789-0.863) positioned GDF-15 in the range of good to excellent diagnostic accuracy according to established criteria. Positive likelihood ratio of 6.1 (95% CI: 4.2-8.9) suggested that a positive GDF-15 test result increased the probability of mitochondrial disease by approximately six-fold, while the negative likelihood ratio of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.18-0.34) indicated that a negative result reduced the probability by 75%.

Heterogeneity assessment revealed moderate statistical heterogeneity for sensitivity (I² = 31.4%) and low-moderate heterogeneity for specificity (I² = 28.7%). The overall between-study variance (τ² = 0.089) was relatively low, and Cochran's Q test (Q = 8.73, p = 0.189) did not reach statistical significance, suggesting acceptable homogeneity across studies. This moderate heterogeneity likely reflected differences in patient populations, disease severity, and analytical platforms rather than fundamental differences in biomarker performance.

#### 3.3.2 Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21)

Five studies contributed data for FGF-21 meta-analysis, including 335 patients and 383 controls from European, Asian, and North American populations. These studies spanned from 2011 to 2019, representing the foundational evidence for FGF-21 as a mitochondrial disease biomarker. All studies employed ELISA methodology, though different manufacturers were represented, including R&D Systems (3 studies) and BioVendor (2 studies). Serum was the exclusive biomaterial across all studies. Notably, cutoff values demonstrated substantial variability, ranging from 200 to 350 pg/mL, highlighting the need for analytical standardization.

Meta-analysis results demonstrated good diagnostic performance for FGF-21, though slightly lower than GDF-15. Pooled sensitivity of 69.6% (95% CI: 63.2-76.0%) indicated that approximately seven out of ten patients with mitochondrial diseases would be correctly identified. Pooled specificity of 87.8% (95% CI: 83.4-92.2%) was comparable to GDF-15, demonstrating excellent ability to correctly classify individuals without mitochondrial diseases. The diagnostic odds ratio of 16.8 (95% CI: 9.7-29.1) indicated strong discriminatory performance, with patients having nearly 17-fold higher odds of elevated FGF-21 levels.

The summary AUC of 0.787 (95% CI: 0.743-0.831) positioned FGF-21 in the good diagnostic accuracy range. Positive likelihood ratio of 5.7 (95% CI: 3.8-8.5) suggested that positive FGF-21 results increased disease probability by approximately six-fold, while negative likelihood ratio of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.44) indicated that negative results reduced probability by 65%.

Heterogeneity assessment revealed low-moderate statistical heterogeneity for both sensitivity (I² = 28.7%) and specificity (I² = 24.3%). The overall between-study variance (τ² = 0.067) was low, and Cochran's Q test (Q = 5.61, p = 0.230) did not reach statistical significance, indicating acceptable homogeneity. The observed heterogeneity primarily reflected differences in cutoff values and assay manufacturers rather than fundamental performance variations.

#### 3.3.3 Lactate

Four studies provided data for lactate meta-analysis, encompassing 425 patients and 246 controls from European and North American institutions. These studies, published between 2008 and 2018, represented the longest experience with lactate as a mitochondrial disease biomarker. All studies employed standard enzymatic assays available in routine clinical laboratories. Biomaterial consisted of serum in three studies and plasma in one study. Cutoff values ranged from 2.0 to 2.5 mmol/L, with sampling conditions varying between fasting (3 studies) and non-fasting (1 study) states.

Meta-analysis results revealed moderate diagnostic performance for lactate, substantially lower than protein biomarkers. Pooled sensitivity of 62.5% (95% CI: 55.1-69.9%) indicated that approximately six out of ten patients would be correctly identified, representing the lowest sensitivity among evaluated biomarkers. Pooled specificity of 80.8% (95% CI: 75.2-86.4%) was also lower than protein biomarkers, though still clinically acceptable. The diagnostic odds ratio of 7.2 (95% CI: 4.1-12.6) indicated moderate discriminatory ability.

The summary AUC of 0.716 (95% CI: 0.672-0.760) positioned lactate in the fair to good diagnostic accuracy range, approaching the threshold for clinical utility. Positive likelihood ratio of 3.3 (95% CI: 2.4-4.5) suggested modest increases in disease probability with positive results, while negative likelihood ratio of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37-0.58) indicated moderate reductions in probability with negative results.

Heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial statistical heterogeneity for both sensitivity (I² = 67.2%) and specificity (I² = 58.9%). The between-study variance (τ² = 0.234) was notably higher than other biomarkers, and Cochran's Q test (Q = 12.47, p = 0.006) reached statistical significance, indicating significant heterogeneity. This heterogeneity reflected multiple factors including sampling conditions (fasting versus non-fasting), patient populations (MELAS-enriched versus mixed conditions), exercise testing protocols, and comorbidity influences.

**Figure 3** presents comprehensive forest plots for all three biomarkers, displaying individual study results alongside pooled estimates. The forest plots demonstrate the contribution of each study to the overall meta-analysis, with point estimates proportional to study sample sizes and confidence intervals reflecting study precision. For GDF-15 (Panel A), the forest plot shows relatively consistent performance across studies with narrow confidence intervals around the pooled estimate. FGF-21 results (Panel B) demonstrate good consistency despite different cutoff values, while lactate results (Panel C) show greater variability reflecting the substantial heterogeneity identified in statistical analysis.

Individual study results are represented by circles (sensitivity) and squares (specificity), with point sizes proportional to sample sizes. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals, and vertical dashed lines indicate pooled estimates.

### 3.4 Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis

Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) analysis provided comprehensive visualization of diagnostic performance across different cutoff values and study populations. **Figure 4** presents SROC curves for all evaluated biomarkers, demonstrating the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity while accounting for threshold effects and between-study heterogeneity.

![Figure 4: SROC Curves](../figures/Figure4_sroc_curves.png)

**Figure 4. Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) Curves for Biomarker Diagnostic Performance.** The figure displays SROC curves for GDF-15 (blue), FGF-21 (purple), and lactate (orange), with individual study points and summary curves with confidence regions. GDF-15 demonstrates the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.826), followed by FGF-21 (AUC 0.787) and lactate (AUC 0.716). The diagonal reference line represents no discrimination. Individual study points show the distribution of sensitivity-specificity pairs, while the smooth curves represent the summary relationships accounting for threshold effects.

The SROC analysis revealed distinct performance characteristics for each biomarker. GDF-15 demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.826, indicating excellent discrimination between patients and controls. The SROC curve showed relatively consistent performance across studies with minimal scatter around the summary curve, reflecting the moderate heterogeneity observed in statistical analysis. The curve's position in the upper-left quadrant of the ROC space indicated optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity.

FGF-21 showed good diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.787, positioning it in the good accuracy range. The SROC curve demonstrated more variability in the sensitivity-specificity trade-off compared to GDF-15, reflecting differences in cutoff values across studies. Despite this variability, the overall curve maintained good diagnostic performance, particularly in the high-specificity range.

Lactate exhibited the lowest diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.716, approaching the threshold for clinical utility. The SROC curve showed substantial scatter around the summary estimate, reflecting the significant heterogeneity identified in meta-analysis. The curve's position indicated moderate diagnostic performance with particular challenges in achieving high sensitivity while maintaining acceptable specificity.

The confidence regions around each SROC curve provided insight into the precision of summary estimates. GDF-15 showed the narrowest confidence region, reflecting consistent performance across studies. FGF-21 demonstrated moderate confidence intervals, while lactate showed the widest confidence region, consistent with the substantial heterogeneity observed.

### 3.5 Subgroup Analyses

#### 3.5.1 Age-Stratified Analysis

Age-stratified analysis revealed clinically important differences in biomarker performance between pediatric and adult populations, with implications for clinical implementation and reference range establishment.

**Pediatric populations (≤18 years)** comprised 8 studies with 312 patients and 298 controls. GDF-15 performance in pediatric populations demonstrated sensitivity of 74.2% (95% CI: 66.8-81.6%) and specificity of 86.3% (95% CI: 81.2-91.4%), representing slightly lower sensitivity compared to adult populations. The optimal cutoff value for pediatric patients was 1,200 pg/mL, lower than adult recommendations. FGF-21 performance showed sensitivity of 65.4% (95% CI: 57.1-73.7%) and specificity of 84.0% (95% CI: 78.6-89.4%), with an optimal cutoff of 300 pg/mL.

**Adult populations (>18 years)** encompassed 12 studies with 687 patients and 645 controls. GDF-15 performance in adults achieved sensitivity of 81.3% (95% CI: 76.2-86.4%) and specificity of 87.8% (95% CI: 84.1-91.5%), representing significantly higher sensitivity compared to pediatric populations (p<0.05). The optimal cutoff range for adults was 1,400-1,800 pg/mL. FGF-21 performance demonstrated sensitivity of 72.8% (95% CI: 67.3-78.3%) and specificity of 90.2% (95% CI: 86.8-93.6%), with an optimal cutoff of 350 pg/mL.

The age-related differences in biomarker performance likely reflected several biological and pathophysiological factors. Pediatric populations may exhibit different disease mechanisms in childhood-onset conditions, age-related changes in biomarker expression and clearance, developmental variations in metabolic pathways, and different baseline inflammatory states. Adult populations demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy, possibly reflecting more advanced disease states at diagnosis, cumulative mitochondrial damage over time, and age-related changes in biomarker production and regulation.

#### 3.5.2 Condition-Specific Analysis

Condition-specific analysis revealed substantial variations in biomarker performance across different mitochondrial disease phenotypes, providing insights for targeted diagnostic approaches.

**MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes)** patients demonstrated superior biomarker performance across all evaluated markers. Six studies included 234 MELAS patients, revealing GDF-15 sensitivity of 85.6% (95% CI: 78.2-92.1%) and specificity of 89.4% (95% CI: 84.7-94.1%). FGF-21 performance showed sensitivity of 78.3% (95% CI: 69.8-86.8%) and specificity of 91.2% (95% CI: 86.5-95.9%). Remarkably, lactate demonstrated its highest performance in MELAS patients with sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI: 82.1-96.3%) and specificity of 85.7% (95% CI: 79.4-92.0%).

The superior performance in MELAS likely reflected the severe mitochondrial dysfunction characteristic of this condition, acute metabolic decompensation during stroke-like episodes, higher baseline inflammatory state, and specific pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the common m.3243A>G mutation. Additionally, MELAS patients often present with more pronounced metabolic abnormalities, making biomarker detection more reliable.

**Muscle-manifesting mitochondrial diseases** comprised 4 studies with 187 patients, showing particular responsiveness to FGF-21 with sensitivity of 76.3% (95% CI: 70.1-82.5%) and specificity of 89.6% (95% CI: 85.2-94.0%). GDF-15 performance was also excellent with sensitivity of 79.8% (95% CI: 73.4-86.2%) and specificity of 86.1% (95% CI: 81.3-90.9%). The enhanced FGF-21 performance in muscle diseases aligned with its biological role as a myokine and hepatokine, involvement in the muscle-liver metabolic axis, response to exercise intolerance and metabolic stress, and potential therapeutic implications for muscle-targeted interventions.

**MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers)** analysis included 2 studies with 89 patients. GDF-15 demonstrated sensitivity of 79.2% (95% CI: 68.4-89.1%) and specificity of 88.7% (95% CI: 81.2-96.2%), while FGF-21 showed sensitivity of 74.6% (95% CI: 63.1-86.1%) and specificity of 87.3% (95% CI: 79.8-94.8%).

#### 3.5.3 Analytical Method Comparison

Analytical method comparison revealed important differences in biomarker performance related to measurement platforms and standardization requirements.

**GDF-15 analytical platforms** demonstrated performance differences between measurement technologies. ELISA platforms, used in 6 studies, achieved sensitivity of 77.8% (95% CI: 71.9-83.7%) and specificity of 86.9% (95% CI: 82.6-91.2%) with coefficient of variation ranging from 5-12%. The single study employing Simoa technology demonstrated numerically superior performance with sensitivity of 82.4% (95% CI: 74.1-90.7%) and specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 85.7-96.9%) and improved precision with coefficient of variation of 3-8%. While limited data precluded statistical comparison, the Simoa platform's enhanced sensitivity for protein detection suggested potential advantages for clinical implementation.

**FGF-21 assay variability** represented a significant challenge for clinical implementation. Inter-assay variability ranged from 8-15% across different manufacturers, with cutoff value heterogeneity showing 75% variation in optimal thresholds (200-350 pg/mL). Sample stability requirements were stringent, necessitating -80°C storage to maintain analyte integrity. Hemolysis interference significantly impacted results, requiring careful sample handling protocols. Studies using manufacturer-recommended cutoffs showed more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of standardized protocols.

### 3.6 Multi-Biomarker Panels

Multi-biomarker approaches demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to individual biomarkers, supporting the development of integrated diagnostic algorithms for clinical implementation.

#### 3.6.1 Two-Biomarker Combinations

**GDF-15 + FGF-21 combination** was evaluated in 2 studies encompassing 187 participants. This combination achieved sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI: 84.1-94.3%) and specificity of 92.7% (95% CI: 88.9-96.5%), representing substantial improvements of 11.1% in sensitivity and 5.5% in specificity compared to the best-performing single biomarker. The area under the curve reached 0.943 (95% CI: 0.912-0.974), indicating excellent diagnostic accuracy approaching the threshold for clinical implementation.

The enhanced performance of combined biomarkers likely reflected complementary biological pathways, with GDF-15 representing general cellular stress responses and FGF-21 indicating specific metabolic dysfunction. The combination approach also reduced the impact of individual biomarker limitations and provided redundancy for diagnostic confidence.

#### 3.6.2 Three-Biomarker Panels

**GDF-15 + FGF-21 + Lactate combination** was assessed in 1 study with 134 participants. This comprehensive panel achieved sensitivity of 91.8% (95% CI: 87.3-96.3%) and specificity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.1-93.7%), with an area under the curve of 0.956 (95% CI: 0.928-0.984). The three-biomarker panel demonstrated particular effectiveness for complex diagnostic cases where individual biomarkers might provide ambiguous results.

The clinical utility of multi-biomarker panels extended beyond improved diagnostic accuracy to include enhanced confidence in diagnostic decisions, reduced false-positive and false-negative rates, and potential for condition-specific algorithms. However, implementation considerations included increased cost and complexity, need for standardized interpretation algorithms, and requirements for comprehensive quality control across multiple assays.

### 3.7 Emerging Biomarkers

#### 3.7.1 Cell-Free Circulating Mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA)

Cell-free circulating mitochondrial DNA emerged as a promising biomarker for specific applications in mitochondrial disease diagnosis and monitoring. Two studies encompassing 165 patients evaluated ccf-mtDNA using quantitative PCR targeting MT-ND2 and MT-ND1 regions. In MELAS-specific applications, ccf-mtDNA demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.60-0.86), indicating fair to good diagnostic performance.

The clinical utility of ccf-mtDNA extended beyond diagnostic applications to include monitoring of acute events and disease progression, assessment of real-time mitochondrial damage, and potential prognostic stratification. The biomarker's ability to reflect dynamic changes in mitochondrial function made it particularly valuable for monitoring stroke-like episodes in MELAS patients and assessing treatment responses.

However, ccf-mtDNA implementation faced several challenges including technical complexity requiring specialized qPCR expertise, need for standardized reference gene selection and quantification methods, limited clinical validation data, and requirements for immediate sample processing. Despite these limitations, ccf-mtDNA represented a promising avenue for personalized monitoring approaches in mitochondrial medicine.

#### 3.7.2 Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL)

Neurofilament light chain evaluation encompassed 3 studies with 187 patients, demonstrating sensitivity of 68.4% (95% CI: 59.7-77.1%) and specificity of 82.1% (95% CI: 75.8-88.4%). NfL measurement employed Simoa immunoassay technology, providing high sensitivity for this neuronal protein. Clinical utility focused on assessment of neurological involvement in mitochondrial diseases, with cerebrospinal fluid samples showing higher sensitivity than serum measurements.

The advantages of NfL included its ability to reflect axonal damage and neurodegeneration, availability in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and high analytical sensitivity with Simoa technology. However, limitations included non-specificity for mitochondrial diseases, as NfL elevation occurs in various neurological conditions, and limited validation data specific to mitochondrial disorders.

#### 3.7.3 Additional Emerging Biomarkers

**Gelsolin** evaluation in 2 studies with 134 patients demonstrated sensitivity of 71.2% (95% CI: 62.4-80.0%) and specificity of 78.9% (95% CI: 71.2-86.6%). Clinical utility focused on muscle involvement assessment, with advantages including muscle-specific expression patterns. However, limitations included limited validation data and moderate diagnostic performance.

**Humanin**, a mitochondrial-derived peptide, showed preliminary evidence in 1 study with 67 patients, achieving sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 75.0%. While representing an interesting mitochondrial-specific biomarker, very limited data precluded definitive conclusions about clinical utility.

**Cytochrome c** evaluation in 2 studies with 98 patients demonstrated sensitivity of 58.3% and specificity of 72.1%. Despite representing a direct mitochondrial marker reflecting membrane integrity, diagnostic accuracy was insufficient for clinical implementation.

**Coenzyme Q10** assessment in 3 studies with 156 patients showed sensitivity of 45.2% and specificity of 68.9%. While representing an important component of the respiratory chain and potential therapeutic target, diagnostic performance was inadequate for clinical use.

### 3.8 Heterogeneity Analysis and Meta-Regression

#### 3.8.1 Sources of Heterogeneity

Comprehensive heterogeneity analysis identified multiple factors contributing to between-study variation in biomarker performance. For GDF-15, age distribution explained 23% of observed heterogeneity, with adult populations showing consistently higher sensitivity. Analytical platform differences between ELISA and Simoa accounted for 15% of heterogeneity, while disease severity variations and geographic factors showed minimal impact.

FGF-21 heterogeneity analysis revealed cutoff values as the primary source, explaining 45% of between-study variation. Different assay manufacturers contributed 12% performance variation, while sample handling conditions, particularly storage requirements, significantly affected results. Population characteristics, specifically the proportion of muscle-manifesting diseases, influenced overall performance metrics.

Lactate demonstrated the highest heterogeneity, with sampling conditions (fasting versus non-fasting) explaining 38% of variation. Disease phenotype composition, particularly MELAS-enriched cohorts, substantially influenced sensitivity estimates. Exercise testing protocols and comorbidity presence, especially diabetes and other metabolic conditions, significantly affected specificity measurements.

#### 3.8.2 Meta-Regression Analysis

Meta-regression analysis identified continuous variables significantly associated with diagnostic performance across studies. Mean patient age emerged as a significant predictor of sensitivity (β = 0.008 per year, p = 0.023), with older populations demonstrating higher biomarker levels. Disease duration showed negative association with sensitivity (β = -0.012 per year, p = 0.041), possibly reflecting adaptation mechanisms or treatment effects. Sample size positively correlated with sensitivity (β = 0.003 per participant, p = 0.038), suggesting potential small-study effects.

Specificity predictors included control group age matching (β = 0.15 for matched controls, p = 0.012), emphasizing the importance of appropriate control selection. Analytical coefficient of variation negatively impacted specificity (β = -0.08 per % CV increase, p = 0.029), highlighting the importance of assay precision for clinical implementation.

### 3.9 Publication Bias Assessment

Publication bias assessment was limited by the relatively small number of studies per biomarker, though available evidence suggested minimal bias. For GDF-15 with 7 studies, visual inspection of funnel plots showed no obvious asymmetry, with studies distributed relatively symmetrically around the pooled estimate. Egger's test did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.234), suggesting absence of small-study effects or publication bias.

Similar patterns were observed for FGF-21 and lactate, though statistical power was limited by small study numbers. The absence of obvious publication bias likely reflected the clinical importance of biomarker research in mitochondrial diseases, leading to publication of both positive and negative results, and the relatively recent emergence of this research field with less time for selective publication practices to develop.

**Figure 5** presents a comprehensive comparison of biomarker performance across multiple dimensions. Panel A displays the sensitivity-specificity relationship for all biomarkers, clearly demonstrating GDF-15's superior position in the upper-right quadrant.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Principal Findings

This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis represents the most extensive evaluation of circulating biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases to date, encompassing 32 high-quality studies and nearly 3,000 participants. Our analysis provides robust evidence supporting the clinical utility of several biomarkers, with important insights into their comparative performance, optimal applications, and implementation considerations.

Growth differentiation factor 15 emerges as the most promising single biomarker with pooled sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 87.2%, achieving a summary AUC of 0.826. The moderate heterogeneity and consistent performance across age groups and disease conditions support its potential for clinical implementation. The diagnostic odds ratio of 22.4 indicates strong discriminatory ability, while the positive likelihood ratio of 6.1 suggests clinically meaningful diagnostic utility. These findings position GDF-15 as the leading candidate for first-line biomarker testing in suspected mitochondrial diseases.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 demonstrates complementary diagnostic value with comparable specificity but lower sensitivity compared to GDF-15. The lower heterogeneity suggests more consistent performance across studies, though the wide range of cutoff values highlights critical standardization needs. The biomarker shows particular strength in muscle-manifesting diseases, consistent with its biological role in muscle metabolism and the hepatokine response to muscle dysfunction. These findings support FGF-21's role as a confirmatory biomarker, particularly in specific clinical contexts.

Lactate, while traditionally important in mitochondrial disease evaluation, shows limitations as a standalone diagnostic biomarker with the lowest overall performance and highest heterogeneity. However, its performance improves significantly in specific contexts, particularly in MELAS patients and when combined with other biomarkers. These findings support lactate's continued role in comprehensive diagnostic panels while highlighting the need for context-specific interpretation.

Multi-biomarker approaches demonstrate superior performance, with two-biomarker combinations achieving greater than 90% diagnostic accuracy. This finding supports the development of integrated diagnostic algorithms rather than reliance on single biomarkers, reflecting the complex pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases and the complementary information provided by different biomarker classes.

### 4.2 Clinical Implications and Implementation

The evidence supports a paradigm shift toward biomarker-guided diagnosis in mitochondrial medicine, with the potential to reduce diagnostic delays, improve patient outcomes, and enable more personalized therapeutic approaches. Based on our findings, we propose a tiered diagnostic approach optimizing both accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

The first tier involves GDF-15 measurement in all suspected cases using age-adjusted cutoffs of 1,200 pg/mL for pediatric patients and 1,400 pg/mL for adults. This approach would achieve approximately 78% sensitivity and 87% specificity, with values above the 95th percentile strongly suggesting mitochondrial disease. The second tier incorporates FGF-21 measurement if GDF-15 is elevated or clinical suspicion remains high, with combined interpretation improving diagnostic accuracy to greater than 90%. This tier proves particularly valuable for muscle-manifesting diseases and requires consideration of condition-specific cutoffs based on phenotype.

The third tier encompasses specialized assessment including ccf-mtDNA for MELAS patients and acute monitoring, neurofilament light chain for neurological involvement assessment, and multi-biomarker panels for diagnostically challenging cases. This tier requires integration with genetic and histopathological findings and access to specialized laboratory expertise.

Age-specific considerations emerge as clinically important, with pediatric populations showing slightly lower sensitivity for both GDF-15 and FGF-21. These differences likely reflect different disease mechanisms in childhood-onset conditions, age-related changes in biomarker expression and clearance, and developmental variations in metabolic pathways. The findings necessitate age-adjusted reference ranges and cutoffs for optimal clinical performance.

Condition-specific applications reveal superior biomarker performance in MELAS patients across all tested markers, likely reflecting more severe mitochondrial dysfunction, acute metabolic decompensation during stroke-like episodes, and specific pathophysiological mechanisms. Muscle-manifesting diseases show particular responsiveness to FGF-21, consistent with its biological role and suggesting potential therapeutic implications for muscle-targeted interventions.

### 4.3 Analytical and Technical Considerations

Successful clinical implementation requires comprehensive standardization efforts addressing pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical factors. Pre-analytical standardization must encompass sample collection protocols including timing, fasting status, and handling procedures. Storage conditions prove critical, particularly for FGF-21 which requires -80°C storage for stability. Hemolysis avoidance represents a significant concern given interference with multiple biomarkers, necessitating careful sample handling protocols and quality assessment procedures.

Analytical standardization involves platform harmonization, particularly addressing ELISA versus Simoa performance differences for GDF-15. Inter-manufacturer variability requires attention, especially for FGF-21 where different manufacturers show substantial performance variation. Quality control protocols must incorporate robust procedures and reference materials, while calibration requires traceable calibrators and standardized units for international comparability.

Post-analytical considerations encompass establishment of age-, sex-, and population-specific reference intervals. Cutoff optimization requires receiver operating characteristic analysis for specific clinical applications, while result interpretation necessitates clinical decision algorithms and expert guidance. Reporting standards must incorporate standardized formats and uncertainty estimates for clinical decision-making.

Quality assurance implementation requires comprehensive frameworks including laboratory certification with ISO 15189 medical laboratory accreditation. Participation in external quality assessment schemes ensures ongoing performance monitoring, while regular method validation and verification maintain analytical quality. Competency assessment for personnel ensures appropriate expertise for biomarker testing and interpretation.

### 4.4 Comparison with Previous Evidence

Our findings extend and refine previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses while providing the first comprehensive quantitative synthesis with formal heterogeneity assessment and clinical implementation guidance. Previous individual biomarker studies generally reported higher performance than our pooled estimates, likely reflecting publication bias, selective reporting, and single-center effects. Our meta-analytical approach provides more realistic performance expectations for clinical implementation.

The larger dataset enables more precise estimates and comprehensive subgroup analyses not previously possible. Our condition-specific and age-stratified analyses provide novel insights into optimal biomarker applications, while the multi-biomarker panel evaluation offers new directions for clinical implementation. The emerging biomarker assessment provides the first systematic evaluation of newer markers including ccf-mtDNA and neurofilament light chain.

### 4.5 Emerging Biomarkers and Future Directions

Cell-free circulating mitochondrial DNA shows particular promise for MELAS monitoring and acute event assessment, with the ability to reflect real-time mitochondrial damage making it valuable for acute stroke-like episode monitoring, treatment response assessment, and disease progression tracking. However, standardization challenges include technical complexity requiring specialized qPCR expertise, reference gene selection considerations, and quantification method optimization.

Neurofilament light chain represents a promising biomarker for neurological involvement assessment with advantages including reflection of axonal damage, availability in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and high analytical sensitivity with Simoa technology. However, limitations include non-specificity for mitochondrial diseases and limited validation data specific to mitochondrial disorders.

Future biomarker development should integrate multiple molecular levels including comprehensive protein biomarker panels, metabolic pathway signatures, membrane composition changes through lipidomics, and genetic variant-biomarker interactions. This multi-omics approach promises more comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial disease pathophysiology and improved diagnostic accuracy.

### 4.6 Limitations and Methodological Considerations

Several limitations require acknowledgment in interpreting our findings. Study-level heterogeneity in populations, despite moderate I² values, reflects the clinical reality of mitochondrial diseases but complicates interpretation. Reference standard evolution over the study period potentially affects comparability, with earlier studies relying more heavily on histopathological criteria while recent studies incorporate genetic findings.

Limited longitudinal data restricts assessment of biomarker utility for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and prognostic applications. Most studies employed cross-sectional designs, limiting understanding of biomarker dynamics over time and their relationship to clinical outcomes.

Meta-analysis limitations include publication bias assessment restricted by small study numbers, though available evidence suggests minimal bias. Individual patient data unavailability precludes more sophisticated analyses accounting for patient-level covariates and interactions. Emerging biomarker evidence remains limited, restricting definitive conclusions about clinical utility for newer markers.

Clinical translation challenges include real-world validation needs, as most studies were conducted in specialized centers with selected populations. Real-world performance may differ in general clinical settings with broader patient populations and varying expertise levels. Health economic evaluation data remains limited for guiding implementation decisions and reimbursement policies, while regulatory considerations present complex and time-consuming biomarker qualification pathways.

### 4.7 Future Research Priorities

Immediate research needs encompass standardization studies including multi-center validation studies for GDF-15 and FGF-21, reference material development and distribution, inter-laboratory proficiency testing programs, and harmonized analytical protocols. Pediatric validation requires dedicated studies with age-specific reference ranges, developmental trajectory studies, and pediatric-specific cutoff optimization with safety and feasibility assessment.

Longitudinal cohort studies represent critical needs including natural history studies with serial biomarker measurements, treatment response monitoring validation, prognostic biomarker development, and disease progression modeling. These studies would address current limitations in understanding biomarker dynamics and clinical utility for monitoring applications.

Medium-term goals include clinical utility studies with randomized controlled trials of biomarker-guided diagnosis, health economic evaluations, implementation science studies, and real-world evidence generation. Multi-biomarker panel development requires optimal biomarker combinations for different clinical scenarios, machine learning approaches to panel optimization, point-of-care testing development, and integration with genetic and imaging data.

Therapeutic biomarker development encompasses treatment response monitoring validation, drug development support applications, clinical trial enrichment strategies, and precision therapy selection. These applications would extend biomarker utility beyond diagnosis to therapeutic decision-making and monitoring.

Long-term vision includes precision medicine implementation with genotype-specific biomarker algorithms, personalized diagnostic and prognostic models, population-specific reference ranges, and artificial intelligence integration. Global standardization efforts require international consensus guidelines, worldwide quality assurance programs, harmonized regulatory pathways, and equitable access strategies.

### 4.8 Clinical Practice Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical implementation. Immediate implementation with high evidence includes GDF-15 testing in specialized mitochondrial disease centers using age-adjusted cutoffs and proper sample handling protocols. Results should be interpreted in clinical context with expert consultation, supported by standardized analytical protocols with quality control measures and laboratory certification requirements.

Multi-biomarker approaches should be considered for complex cases, combining GDF-15 and FGF-21 for improved diagnostic accuracy while considering condition-specific biomarker panels and integration with genetic and histopathological findings. These approaches require specialized expertise and comprehensive quality assurance.

Conditional implementation with moderate evidence includes FGF-21 testing as confirmatory biomarker, particularly valuable for muscle-manifesting diseases but requiring analytical method standardization and consideration of manufacturer-specific cutoffs. ccf-mtDNA represents specialized applications for MELAS monitoring and acute event assessment, though requiring specialized laboratory expertise and initial limitation to research and specialized centers.

Research and development priorities encompass pediatric-specific validation studies, longitudinal monitoring applications, point-of-care testing development, health economic evaluation, and regulatory approval pathways. These priorities would address current evidence gaps and facilitate broader clinical implementation.

## 5. Conclusions

Fibroblast growth factor 21 provides valuable confirmatory testing with sensitivity of 69.6%, specificity of 87.8%, and area under the curve of 0.787, particularly for muscle-manifesting diseases. However, standardization of analytical methods remains critical for widespread implementation, with attention to manufacturer-specific variations and storage requirements.

Multi-biomarker panels significantly improve diagnostic performance, achieving greater than 90% accuracy when biomarkers are combined. This represents the optimal approach for clinical implementation, reflecting the complex pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases and the complementary information provided by different biomarker classes.

Condition-specific and age-adjusted algorithms enhance diagnostic utility, with superior performance demonstrated in MELAS and adult populations. These findings support personalized diagnostic approaches tailored to specific clinical contexts and patient populations.

Emerging biomarkers including cell-free circulating mitochondrial DNA and neurofilament light chain show promise for specialized applications but require further validation. These markers offer potential for monitoring applications and assessment of specific disease aspects beyond initial diagnosis.

The evidence supports a paradigm shift toward biomarker-guided diagnosis in mitochondrial medicine, with potential to reduce diagnostic delays, improve patient outcomes, and enable more personalized therapeutic approaches. However, successful implementation requires coordinated efforts in standardization, quality assurance, clinical validation, and healthcare system integration.

Future research priorities include standardization and validation studies, longitudinal cohort studies for monitoring applications, health economic evaluations, point-of-care testing development, and precision medicine approaches. These priorities would address current evidence gaps and facilitate the transition from research findings to clinical practice.

This work establishes a robust foundation for evidence-based clinical implementation while identifying critical research priorities to advance the field toward precision medicine for mitochondrial diseases. The comprehensive framework developed here provides a model for systematic evaluation of biomarkers in other complex disease areas, supporting the broader goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes through evidence-based biomarker implementation.
