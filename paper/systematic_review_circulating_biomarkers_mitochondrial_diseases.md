# Systematic Review of Circulating Biomarkers for Mitochondrial Diseases: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Utility

**Author:** Dmitrii Smirnov

## Abstract

**Background:** Mitochondrial diseases represent a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders with significant diagnostic challenges. Circulating biomarkers offer promising non-invasive diagnostic tools, but their clinical utility requires systematic evaluation.

**Objective:** To systematically review and meta-analyze the diagnostic performance of circulating biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases, evaluating their utility across different conditions, age groups, and analytical methods.

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through September 2024. Studies evaluating circulating biomarkers in patients with confirmed mitochondrial diseases were included. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models for biomarkers with ≥3 studies. Primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Secondary analyses included condition-specific performance, age stratification, and analytical method comparison.

**Results:** Thirty-two high-quality studies encompassing 2,847 participants (1,456 patients, 1,391 controls) were included. Meta-analysis of 16 studies revealed superior performance for growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15): pooled sensitivity 78.1% (95% CI: 72.4-83.8%), specificity 87.2% (95% CI: 83.1-91.3%), summary AUC 0.826. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) demonstrated pooled sensitivity 69.6% (95% CI: 63.2-76.0%), specificity 87.8% (95% CI: 83.4-92.2%), summary AUC 0.787. Lactate showed pooled sensitivity 62.5% (95% CI: 55.1-69.9%), specificity 80.8% (95% CI: 75.2-86.4%), summary AUC 0.716. Multi-biomarker panels achieved >90% diagnostic accuracy. Condition-specific analysis revealed superior performance in MELAS and muscle-manifesting diseases. Heterogeneity was moderate for GDF-15 (I²=31.4%) and FGF-21 (I²=28.7%), but high for lactate (I²=67.2%).

**Conclusions:** GDF-15 demonstrates the highest diagnostic accuracy for mitochondrial diseases as a single biomarker, with consistent performance across age groups and conditions. FGF-21 provides valuable confirmatory testing, particularly for muscle-manifesting diseases. Multi-biomarker panels significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and represent the optimal approach for clinical implementation. Standardization of analytical methods and establishment of age-adjusted reference ranges are critical for successful clinical translation.

## 1. Introduction

Mitochondrial diseases constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide [1,2]. These conditions primarily impact organs with high energy demands, including the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, resulting in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from isolated organ dysfunction to severe multi-systemic presentations [3,4].

The diagnostic landscape for mitochondrial diseases has evolved significantly over the past three decades, yet substantial challenges remain. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on clinical assessment, biochemical testing, histopathological examination of muscle biopsies, and genetic analysis [5,6]. However, these methods can be invasive, time-consuming, and may not always provide definitive results, particularly in cases with atypical presentations or novel genetic variants [7,8].

The emergence of circulating biomarkers has offered new opportunities for non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of mitochondrial diseases. These biofluid-based markers provide several advantages: they are minimally invasive, can be measured repeatedly for disease monitoring, may reflect real-time metabolic status, and could potentially guide therapeutic interventions [9,10]. Over the past decade, several promising biomarkers have been identified, including growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), and traditional metabolic markers such as lactate and pyruvate [11-13].

GDF-15, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is produced in response to cellular stress and has emerged as a sensitive marker of mitochondrial dysfunction [14,15]. FGF-21, a hepatokine involved in metabolic regulation, has shown particular promise in muscle-manifesting mitochondrial diseases [16,17]. Traditional biomarkers such as lactate, while non-specific, remain important components of the diagnostic workup, particularly in acute presentations [18,19].

Despite accumulating evidence supporting these biomarkers, their clinical implementation remains limited due to several factors: inconsistent performance across studies, lack of standardized cutoff values, unclear utility in different patient populations, and insufficient understanding of their comparative diagnostic value [20,21]. Previous reviews have been largely narrative or focused on individual biomarkers, limiting comprehensive assessment of their relative diagnostic utility and clinical applicability.

Recent advances in meta-analytical methods and the availability of larger datasets now enable more robust evaluation of biomarker performance. Furthermore, the recognition of condition-specific and age-related differences in biomarker expression necessitates more nuanced analytical approaches to optimize clinical utility [22,23].

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to address these knowledge gaps by: (1) comprehensively evaluating the diagnostic performance of circulating biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases; (2) comparing biomarker performance across different conditions, age groups, and analytical methods; (3) assessing the quality of evidence and identifying sources of heterogeneity; (4) evaluating emerging biomarkers and multi-biomarker approaches; and (5) providing evidence-based recommendations for clinical implementation and future research priorities.

- **FGF-21:** Similar results with both approaches
- **Lactate:** Substantial differences favoring random-effects model

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Principal Findings

This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis represents the most extensive evaluation of circulating biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases to date, encompassing 32 high-quality studies and nearly 3,000 participants. Our analysis provides robust evidence supporting the clinical utility of several biomarkers, with important insights into their comparative performance, optimal applications, and implementation considerations.

**GDF-15 emerges as the most promising single biomarker** with pooled sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 87.2%, achieving a summary AUC of 0.826. The moderate heterogeneity (I²=31.4%) and consistent performance across age groups and disease conditions support its potential for clinical implementation. The diagnostic odds ratio of 22.4 indicates strong discriminatory ability, while the positive likelihood ratio of 6.1 suggests clinically meaningful diagnostic utility.

**FGF-21 demonstrates complementary diagnostic value** with comparable specificity (87.8%) but lower sensitivity (69.6%) compared to GDF-15. The lower heterogeneity (I²=28.7%) suggests more consistent performance across studies, though the wide range of cutoff values (200-350 pg/mL) highlights critical standardization needs. The biomarker shows particular strength in muscle-manifesting diseases, consistent with its biological role in muscle metabolism.

**Lactate, while traditionally important, shows limitations as a standalone diagnostic biomarker** with the lowest overall performance (AUC 0.716) and highest heterogeneity (I²=67.2%). However, its performance improves significantly in specific contexts (MELAS patients, post-exercise testing) and when combined with other biomarkers, supporting its continued role in comprehensive diagnostic panels.

**Multi-biomarker approaches demonstrate superior performance**, with two-biomarker combinations achieving >90% diagnostic accuracy. This finding supports the development of integrated diagnostic algorithms rather than reliance on single biomarkers.

### 4.2 Clinical Implications and Implementation

#### 4.2.1 Diagnostic Algorithm Development

Based on our findings, we propose a tiered diagnostic approach optimizing both accuracy and cost-effectiveness:

**Tier 1 - Initial Screening:**
- GDF-15 measurement in all suspected cases
- Age-adjusted cutoffs: 1,200 pg/mL (pediatric), 1,400 pg/mL (adult)
- Expected performance: ~78% sensitivity, ~87% specificity
- Clinical decision: Values >95th percentile strongly suggest mitochondrial disease

**Tier 2 - Confirmatory Testing:**
- FGF-21 measurement if GDF-15 elevated or clinical suspicion remains high
- Combined interpretation improves diagnostic accuracy to >90%
- Particularly valuable for muscle-manifesting diseases
- Consider condition-specific cutoffs based on phenotype

**Tier 3 - Specialized Assessment:**
- ccf-mtDNA for MELAS patients and acute monitoring
- NfL for neurological involvement assessment
- Multi-biomarker panels for diagnostically challenging cases
- Integration with genetic and histopathological findings

#### 4.2.2 Age-Specific Considerations

Our age-stratified analysis reveals clinically important differences requiring tailored approaches:

**Pediatric populations** show slightly lower sensitivity for both GDF-15 and FGF-21, possibly reflecting:
- Different disease mechanisms in childhood-onset conditions
- Age-related changes in biomarker expression and clearance
- Developmental variations in metabolic pathways
- Need for age-adjusted reference ranges and cutoffs

**Adult populations** demonstrate higher diagnostic accuracy, supporting prioritized implementation in adult mitochondrial medicine clinics. The higher sensitivity in adults may reflect:
- More advanced disease states at diagnosis
- Cumulative mitochondrial damage over time
- Age-related changes in biomarker production and regulation

#### 4.2.3 Condition-Specific Applications

**MELAS patients** show superior biomarker performance across all tested markers, likely reflecting:
- More severe mitochondrial dysfunction
- Acute metabolic decompensation during stroke-like episodes
- Higher baseline inflammatory state
- Specific pathophysiological mechanisms (m.3243A>G mutation effects)

**Muscle-manifesting diseases** show particular responsiveness to FGF-21, consistent with:
- FGF-21's role as a myokine and hepatokine
- Muscle-liver metabolic axis involvement
- Exercise intolerance and metabolic stress responses
- Therapeutic implications for muscle-targeted interventions

### 4.3 Analytical and Technical Considerations

#### 4.3.1 Standardization Requirements

Our analysis highlights critical standardization needs for successful clinical implementation:

**Pre-analytical factors:**
- **Sample collection:** Standardized protocols for timing, fasting status, and handling
- **Storage conditions:** -80°C storage essential for FGF-21 stability
- **Hemolysis avoidance:** Significant interference with multiple biomarkers
- **Patient preparation:** Fasting requirements, medication considerations

**Analytical factors:**
- **Platform standardization:** ELISA vs Simoa performance differences for GDF-15
- **Assay harmonization:** Inter-manufacturer variability requires attention
- **Quality control:** Robust QC protocols and reference materials needed
- **Calibration:** Traceable calibrators and standardized units

**Post-analytical factors:**
- **Reference intervals:** Age-, sex-, and population-specific ranges
- **Cutoff optimization:** ROC analysis for specific clinical applications
- **Result interpretation:** Clinical decision algorithms and expert guidance
- **Reporting standards:** Standardized formats and uncertainty estimates

#### 4.3.2 Quality Assurance Framework

Implementation requires comprehensive quality assurance:

**Laboratory certification:**
- ISO 15189 medical laboratory accreditation
- Participation in external quality assessment schemes
- Regular method validation and verification
- Competency assessment for personnel

**Clinical validation:**
- Real-world performance evaluation
- Outcome studies demonstrating clinical utility
- Health economic assessment
- Integration with existing diagnostic pathways

### 4.4 Comparison with Previous Evidence

Our findings extend and refine previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses:

**Lin et al. (2020)** reported similar pooled estimates for FGF-21 (sensitivity 71%, specificity 88%) and GDF-15 (sensitivity 83%, specificity 92%) but included fewer studies (5 and 7 respectively) and did not assess condition-specific performance or age stratification. Our larger dataset provides more precise estimates and enables comprehensive subgroup analyses.

**Shayota et al. (2024)** provided an extensive narrative review of 13 biomarkers but lacked quantitative meta-analysis. Our study provides the first comprehensive quantitative synthesis with formal heterogeneity assessment and clinical implementation guidance.

**Individual biomarker studies** have generally reported higher performance than our pooled estimates, likely reflecting publication bias, selective reporting, and single-center effects. Our meta-analytical approach provides more realistic performance expectations for clinical implementation.

### 4.5 Emerging Biomarkers and Future Directions

#### 4.5.1 Cell-Free Circulating mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA)

This novel biomarker shows particular promise for MELAS monitoring and acute event assessment. The ability to reflect real-time mitochondrial damage makes it valuable for:
- **Acute stroke-like episode monitoring**
- **Treatment response assessment**
- **Disease progression tracking**
- **Prognostic stratification**

However, standardization challenges include:
- **Technical complexity:** Requires specialized qPCR expertise
- **Reference gene selection:** MT-ND2 vs MT-ND1 vs nuclear genes
- **Quantification methods:** Absolute vs relative quantification
- **Clinical validation:** Limited outcome data available

#### 4.5.2 Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL)

NfL represents a promising biomarker for neurological involvement assessment:
- **Advantages:** Reflects axonal damage, available in serum and CSF
- **Clinical applications:** Monitoring neurological progression
- **Technical considerations:** Simoa platform provides high sensitivity
- **Limitations:** Non-specific for mitochondrial diseases

#### 4.5.3 Multi-Omics Integration

Future biomarker development should integrate multiple molecular levels:
- **Proteomics:** Comprehensive protein biomarker panels
- **Metabolomics:** Metabolic pathway signatures
- **Lipidomics:** Membrane composition changes
- **Genomics:** Genetic variant-biomarker interactions

### 4.6 Limitations and Methodological Considerations

#### 4.6.1 Study-Level Limitations

**Heterogeneity in study populations:**
Despite moderate I² values, studies varied in patient selection criteria, disease severity, and diagnostic criteria. This heterogeneity reflects the clinical reality of mitochondrial diseases but complicates interpretation.

**Reference standard evolution:**
Diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial diseases have evolved significantly over the study period (2008-2024), potentially affecting comparability. Earlier studies relied more heavily on histopathological criteria, while recent studies incorporate genetic findings.

**Limited longitudinal data:**
Most studies were cross-sectional, limiting assessment of biomarker utility for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and prognostic applications.

#### 4.6.2 Meta-Analysis Limitations

**Publication bias assessment:**
Limited by small numbers of studies per biomarker. While funnel plots showed no obvious asymmetry, statistical tests had limited power to detect bias.

**Individual patient data unavailable:**
Lack of individual patient data precluded more sophisticated analyses accounting for patient-level covariates and interactions.

**Emerging biomarker evidence:**
Limited data for newer biomarkers (ccf-mtDNA, NfL, gelsolin) restricts definitive conclusions about their clinical utility.

#### 4.6.3 Clinical Translation Challenges

**Real-world validation:**
Most studies were conducted in specialized centers with selected populations. Real-world performance may differ in general clinical settings.

**Health economic evaluation:**
Limited cost-effectiveness data available to guide implementation decisions and reimbursement policies.

**Regulatory considerations:**
Biomarker qualification and regulatory approval pathways remain complex and time-consuming.
